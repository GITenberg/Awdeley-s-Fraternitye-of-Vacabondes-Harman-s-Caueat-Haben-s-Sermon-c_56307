<h2 class="h2herein" title="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>If the ways and slang of Vagabonds and Beggars interested
Martin Luther enough to make him write a preface to the
<i>Liber Vagatorum</i><a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a>
in 1528, two of the ungodly may be excused for caring, in
1869, for the old Rogues of their English land, and for putting
together three of the earliest tracts about them. Moreover, these
tracts are part of the illustrative matter that we want round our great
book on Elizabethan England, Harrison’s <i>Description of Britain</i>, and
the chief of them is quoted by the excellent parson who wrote that
book.</p>

<p>The first of these three tracts, Awdeley’s <i>Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i>,
has been treated by many hasty bibliographers, who can never
have taken the trouble to read the first three leaves of Harman’s
book, as later than, and a mere pilfering from, Harman’s <i>Caueat</i>. No
such accusation, however, did Harman himself bring against the
worthy printer-author (herein like printer-author Crowley, though he
was preacher too,) who preceded him. In his Epistle dedicatory to
the Countes of Shrewsbury, p. <a href="#p020" title="go to page 20">20</a>,
below, Harman, after speaking
of ‘these wyly wanderers,’ vagabonds, says in 1566 or 1567,</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>There was <i>a fewe yeares since</i> a small bréefe setforth of some zelous
man to his countrey,—of whom I knowe not,—that made a lytle shewe
of there names and vsage, and gaue a glymsinge lyghte, not sufficient
to perswade of their peuishe peltinge and pickinge practyses, but well
worthy of prayse.</p></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1"
id="fn1">1</a> <i>Liber Vagatorum: Der Betler Orden</i>: First
printed about 1514. Its first section gives a special account
of the several orders of the ‘Fraternity of Vagabonds;’ the
2nd, sundry <i>notabilia</i> relating to them; the 3rd consists of
a ‘Rotwelsche Vocabulary,’ or ‘Canting Dictionary.’ See a long
notice in the Wiemarisches Jahrbuch, vol. 10; 1856. <i>Hotten’s
Slang Dictionary</i>: Bibliography.</p></div>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-ii">{ii}</span></div>

<p>This description of the ‘small bréefe,’ and the ‘lytle shewe’ of
the ‘names and vsage,’ exactly suits Awdeley’s tract; and the ‘fewe
yeares since’ also suits the date of what may be safely assumed to
be the first edition of the <i>Fraternitye</i>, by John Awdeley or John
Sampson, or Sampson Awdeley,—for by all these names, says Mr
Payne Collier, was our one man known:—</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>It may be disputed whether this printer’s name were really
Sampson, or Awdeley: he was made free of the Stationers’ Company
as Sampson, and so he is most frequently termed towards the
commencement of the Register; but he certainly wrote and printed
his name Awdeley or Awdelay; now and then it stands in the
Register ‘Sampson Awdeley.’ It is the more important to settle
the point, because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was not only a printer,
but a versifier,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a>
and ought to have been included by Ritson in his <i>Bibliographica
Poetica</i>. (Registers of the Stationers’ Company, <span
class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1848, vol. i. p. 23.)</p></div>

<p>These verses of Awdeley’s, or Sampson’s, no doubt led to his
‘small bréefe’ being entered in the Stationers’ Register as a ‘ballett’:</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<div class="dblkquothead">
<p>“1560–1. Rd. of John Sampson, for
his lycense for pryntinge of a ballett
called the description of vakaboundes
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;iiij<sup>d</sup>.</p></div>

<p>“[This entry seems to refer to an early edition of a very
curious work, printed again by Sampson, alias Awdeley, in
1565, when it bore the following title, ‘The fraternitie of
vacabondes, as well of rufling vacabones as of beggerly, <span class="nowrap"><a
class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a>†as</span> well of women
as of men, †and as well of gyrles as of boyes, with their
proper names and qualityes. Also the xxv. orders of knaves,
otherwise called a quartten of knawes. Confirmed this yere by
Cocke Lorel.’ The edition without date mentioned by Dibdin
(iv. 564) may have been that of the entry. Another impression
by Awdeley, dated 1575 [which we reprint] is reviewed in the
<i>British Bibliographer</i>, ii. 12, where it is asserted (as is
very probable, though we are without distinct evidence of the
fact) that the printer was the compiler of the book, and he
certainly introduces it by three six-line stanzas. If this
work came out originally in 1561, according to the entry,
there is no doubt that it was the precursor of a very singular
series of tracts on the same subject, which will be noticed
in their proper places.]”—J. P. Collier, <i>Registers</i>, i.
42.</p></div><!--dblkquot-->

</ul></div>

<p>As above said, I take Harman’s ‘fewe yeares’—in 1566 or 7—to
point to the 1561 edition of Awdeley, and not the 1565 ed. And as to
Awdeley’s authorship,—what can be more express
than his own words, <span class="xxpn" id="p-iii">{iii}</span>
p. <a href="#p002" title="go to page 2">2</a>, below, that what the Vagabond caught at a Session confest as to
‘both names and states of most and least of this their Vacabondes
brotherhood,’ <i>that</i>,—‘at the request of a worshipful man, I [‘The
Printer,’ that is, John Awdeley] have set it forth as well as I can.’</p>

<p>But if a doubt on Awdeley’s priority to Harman exists in any
reader’s mind, let him consider this second reference by Harman to
Awdeley (p. <a href="#p060" title="go to page 60">60</a>, below), not noticed by the bibliographers: “For-as-much
as these two names, a Iarkeman and a Patrico, bée in <i>the
old briefe of vacabonds</i>, and set forth as two kyndes of euil doers,
you shall vnderstande that a Iarkeman hath his name of a <i>Iarke,
which is a seale in their Language</i>, as one should <i>make writinges and
set seales for lycences</i> and pasporte,” and then turn to Awdeley’s
<i>Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i>, and there see, at
page <a href="#p005" title="go to page 5">5</a>, below:</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth"><div class="dblkquot">
<div>¶ <span class="smmaj">A IACK MAN.</span></div>

<p>A Iackeman is he that can write and reade, and sometime
speake latin. He vseth <i>to make counterfaite licences</i> which
they call Gybes, <i>and sets to Seales, in their language called
Iarkes</i>. (See also ‘A Whipiacke,’ p.
<a href="#p004" title="go to page 4">4</a>.)</p></div></div>

<p>Let the reader then compare Harman’s own description of a <i>Patrico</i>,
p. <a href="#p060" title="go to page 60">60</a>, with that in ‘the old
<i>Briefe of Vacabonds</i>,’ Awdeley, p. <a href="#p006" title="go to page

<p>And surely no doubt on the point will remain in his mind, though,
if needed, a few more confirmations could be got, as</p>

</div><!--dblkquot--></div>

<p>We may conclude, then, certainly, that Awdeley did not plagiarize
Harman; and probably, that he first published his <i>Fraternitye</i> in
1561. The tract is a mere sketch, as compared with Harman’s
<i>Caueat</i>, though in its descriptions (p. <a href="#p006" title="go to page 6">6</a>–11)
of ‘A Curtesy Man,’ <span class="xxpn" id="p-iv">{iv}</span>
‘A Cheatour or Fingerer,’ and ‘A Ring-Faller’ (one of whom tried
his tricks on me in Gower-street about ten days ago), it gives as full
a picture as Harman does of the general run of his characters. The
edition of 1575 being the only one accessible to us, our trusty Oxford
copier, Mr George Parker, has read the proofs with the copy in the
Bodleian.</p>

<p>Let no one bring a charge of plagiarizing Awdeley, against Harman,
for the latter, as has been shown, referred fairly to Awdeley’s
‘<i>small breefe</i>’ or ‘<i>old briefe of vacabonds</i>’ and wrote his own “bolde
Beggars booke” (p. <a href="#p091" title="go to page 91">91</a>)
from his own long experience with them.</p>

<hr class="hr30" />

<p>Harman’s <i>Caueat</i> is too well-known and widely valued a book
to need description or eulogy here. It is <i>the</i> standard work on its
subject,—‘these rowsey, ragged, rabblement of rakehelles’
(p. <a href="#p019" title="go to page 19">19</a>)—and
has been largely plundered by divers literary cadgers. No copy
of the first edition seems to be known to bibliographers. It was
published in 1566 or 1567,—probably the latter year,<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a>—and must (I
conclude) have contained less than the second, as in that’s ‘Harman
to the Reader,’ p. <a href="#p028" title="go to page 28">28</a>,
below, he says ‘well good reader, I meane not
to be tedyous vnto the, but haue added fyue or sixe more tales,
because some of them weare doune whyle my booke was fyrste in
the presse.’ He speaks again of his first edition at p.
<a href="#p044" title="go to page 44">44</a>, below, ‘I
had the best geldinge stolen oute of my pasture, that I had amongst
others, whyle this boke was <i>first a printynge</i>;’ and also at p. <a href="#p051" title="go to page 51">51</a>,
below, ‘Apon Alhol enday in the morning last anno domini 1566, or
my booke was halfe printed, I meane <i>the first impression</i>.’ All
Hallows’ or All Saints’ Day is November 1.</p>

Compare the anecdote, p. <a href="#p066" title="go to page 66">66</a>, 68,

Domini, 1566.’</p></div>

<p>The edition called the second<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a>,
also bearing date in 1567, is known
to us in two states, the latter of which I have called the third edition.
The first state of the second edition is shown by the Bodleian copy,
which is ‘Augmented and inlarged by the fyrst author here of,’ and
has, besides smaller differences specified in the footnotes in our
pages, this great difference, that the arrangement
of ‘The Names of <span class="xxpn" id="p-v">{v}</span>
the Vpright Men, Roges, and Pallyards’ is not alphabetical, by the
first letter of the Christian names, as in the second state of the second
edition (which I call the third edition), but higgledy-piggledy, or, at
least, without attention to the succession of initials either of Christian
or Sur-names, thus, though in three columns:</p>

<p>This alone settles the priority of the Bodley edition, as no printer,
having an index alphabetical, would go and muddle it all again, even
for a lark. Moreover, the other collations confirm this priority. The
colophon of the Bodley edition is dated <span class="smmaj">A. D.</span> 1567, ‘the eight of
January;’ and therefore <span class="smmaj">A. D.</span> 1567–8.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p>The second state of the second edition—which state I call the
third edition—is shown by the copy which Mr Henry Huth has,
with his never-failing generosity, lent us to copy and print from. It
omits ‘the eight of January,’ from the colophon, and has ‘Anno
Domini 1567’ only. Like the 2nd edition (or 2 A), this 3rd edition
(or 2 B) has the statement on p. <a href="#p087" title="go to page 87">87</a>, below:
‘Whyle this second <span class="xxpn" id="p-vi">{vi}</span>
Impression was in printinge, it fortuned that Nycholas Blunte, who
called hym selfe Nycholan Gennyns, a counterefet Cranke, that is
spoken of in this booke, was fonde begging in the whyte fryers on
Newe yeares day last past, Anno domini .1567, and commytted vnto
a offescer, who caried hym vnto the depetye of the ward, which co<i>m</i>mytted
hym vnto the counter;’ and this brings both the 2nd and 3rd
editions (or 2 A and 2 B) to the year 1568, modern style. The 4th
edition, so far as I know, was published in 1573, and was reprinted
by Machell Stace (says Bohn’s Lowndes) in 1814. From that reprint
Mr W. M. Wood has made a collation of words, not letters, for us
with the 3rd edition. The chief difference of the 4th edition is its extension
of the story of the ‘dyssembling Cranke,’ Nycholas Genings,
and ‘the Printar of this booke’ Wylliam Gryffith (p. <a href="#p053" title="go to page 53">53</a>–6, below),
which extension is given in the footnotes to pages <a href="#p056" title="go to page 56">56</a> and 57 of our
edition. We were obliged to reprint this from Stace’s reprint of 1814,
as our searchers could not find a copy of the 4th edition of 1573 in
either the British Museum, the Bodleian, or the Cambridge
University Library.</p>

<p>Thus much about our present edition. I now hark back to the
first, and the piracies of it or the later editions, mentioned in Mr J.
P. Collier’s <i>Registers of the Stationers’ Company</i>, i. 155–6, 166.</p>

of 1573. It was the forerunner of various later works of the
same kind, some of which were plundered from it without acknowledgment,
and attributed to the celebrated Robert Greene. Copies of two
editions in 1567, by Griffith, are extant, and, in all probability, it was
the first time it appeared in print: Griffith entered it at Stationers’ Hall,
as above, in 1566, in order that he might publish it in 1567. Harman’s
work was preceded by several ballads relating to vagabonds, the earliest
of which is entered on p. 42

<p>“[All tends to prove the desire of stationers to obtain some
share of the profits of a work, which, as we have already shown,
was so well received, that Griffith published two editions of it
in 1567.]”</p></div>

<p>The fact is, the book was so interesting that it made its readers
thieves, as ‘Jack Sheppard’ has done in later days. The very woodcutter
cheated Harman of the hind legs of the horse on his title,
prigged two of his prauncer’s props (p. <a href="#p042" title="go to page 42">42</a>).</p>

<p>To know the keen inquiring Social Reformer, Thomas Harman, the reader
must go to his book. He lived in the country (p. <a href="#p034"
title="go to page 34">34</a>, foot), in [Crayford] Kent (p. <a
href="#p030" title="go to page 30">30</a>, p. <a href="#p035" title="go
to p. 35">35</a>), near a heath (p. <a href="#p035" title="go to
p. 35">35</a>), near Lady Elizabeth Shrewsbury’s parish (p. <a
href="#p019" title="go to page 19">19</a>), not far from London (p. <a
href="#p030" title="go to page 30">30</a>, p. <a href="#p035" title="go
to p. 35">35</a>); ‘he lodged at the White Friars within the cloister’
(p. <a href="#p051" title="go to page 51">51</a>), seemingly while
he was having his book printed (p. <a href="#p053" title="go to page
53">53</a>), and had his servant there with him (<i>ib.</i>); ‘he knew
London well’ (p. <a href="#p054" title="go to page 54">54</a>, &amp;c.);
and in Kent ‘beinge placed as a poore gentleman,’ he had in 1567,
‘kepte a house these twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty dayely hath
and doth repayre,’ and where, being kept at home ‘through sickenes,
he talked dayly with many of these wyly wanderars, as well men and
wemmen, as boyes and gyrles,’ whose tricks he has so pleasantly set
down for us. He did not, though, confine his intercourse with vagabonds
to talking, for he says of some, p. <a href="#p048" title="go to page
48">48</a>,</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>¶ Some tyme they counterfet the seale of the Admiraltie. I haue
diuers tymes taken a waye from them their

wyth suche money as they haue gathered, and haue confiscated the
same to the pouerty nigh adioyninge to me. p. <a href="#p051" title="go to page 51">51</a>–6.</p></div>

<p>Our author also practically exposed these tricks, as witness his
hunting out the Cranke, Nycholas Genings, and his securing the
vagabond’s 13&#x2060;<i>s.</i> and 4&#x2060;<i>d.</i> for the poor of Newington parish,
p. <a href="#p051" title="go to page 51">51</a>–6,
his making the deaf and dumb beggar hear and speak,
p. <a href="#p058" title="go to page 58">58</a>–9 (and
securing his money too for the poor). But he fed deserving beggars,

<p>Though Harman tells us ‘Eloquence haue I none, I neuer was
acquaynted with the Muses, I neuer tasted of Helycon’ (p. <a
href="#p027" title="go to page 27">27</a>–8), yet he could write

title="go to page 24">24</a>; &amp;c.;—he studied the old Statutes of
the Realm (p. <a href="#p027" title="go to page 27">27</a>); he liked
proverbs (see the Index); he was once ‘in commission of the peace,’
as he says, and judged malefactors, p. <a href="#p060" title="go to
page 60">60</a>, though he evidently was not a Justice when he wrote
his book; he was a ‘gentleman,’ says Harrison (see p. <a href="#p-xii"

class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a> in Queene Marie’s daies,’
says Samuel Rowlands;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a>
he bore arms (of heraldry), and had them duly stamped on his pewter
dishes (p. <a href="#p035" title="go to page 35">35</a>); he had at
least one old ‘tennant who customably a greate tyme went twise in
the weeke to London, (over Blacke Heathe) eyther wyth fruite or with
pescoddes’ (p. <a href="#p030" title="go to page 30">30</a>); he
hospitably asked his visitors to dinner (p. <a href="#p045" title="go

href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a> the best gelding of which the Pryggers of
Prauncers prigged (p. <a href="#p044" title="go to page 44">44</a>); he
had an unchaste cow that went to bull every month (p. <a href="#p067"
title="go to page 67">67</a>, if his ownership is not chaff here);
he had in his ‘well-house on the backe side of <span class="xxpn"
id="p-ix">{ix}</span> his house, a great cawdron of copper’ which the
beggars stole (p. <a href="#p034" title="go to page 34">34</a>–5);
he couldn’t keep his linen on his hedges or in his rooms, or his
pigs and poultry from the thieves (p. <a href="#p021" title="go to
page 21">21</a>); he hated the ‘rascal rabblement’ of them (p. <a
href="#p021" title="go to page 21">21</a>), and ‘the wicked parsons
that keepe typlinge Houses in all shires, where they haue succour and
reliefe’; and, like a wise and practical man, he set himself to find
out and expose all their ‘vndecent, dolefull [guileful] dealing, and
execrable exercyses’ (p. <a href="#p021" title="go to page 21">21</a>)
to the end that they might be stopt, and sin and wickedness might not
so much abound, and thus ‘this Famous Empyre be in more welth, and
better florysh, to the inestymable joye and comfort’ of his great
Queen, Elizabeth, and the ‘vnspeakable .&nbsp;. reliefe and quietnes of
minde, of all her faythfull Commons and Subiectes.’ The right end, and
the right way to it. We’ve some like you still, Thomas Harman, in our
Victorian time. May their number grow!</p>

<p>Thus much about Harman we learn from his book and his
literary contemporaries and successors. If we now turn to the historian
of his county, Hasted, we find further interesting details
about our author: 1, that he lived in Crayford parish, next to
Erith, the Countess of Shrewsbury’s parish; 2, that he inherited
the estates of Ellam, and Maystreet, and the manor of Mayton or
Maxton; 3, that he was the grandson of Henry Harman, Clerk of
the Crown, who had for his arms ‘Argent, a chevron between 3
scalps sable,’ which were no doubt those stampt on our Thomas’s
pewter dishes; 4, that he had a ‘descendant,’—a son, I presume—who
inherited his lands, and three daughters, one of whom, Bridget,
married Henry Binneman—? not the printer, about 1565–85 <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span>, p.
<a href="#p-vi" title="go to page vi">vi</a>–vii, above.</p>

<p>Hasted in his description of the parish of Crayford, speaking of
Ellam, a place in the parish, says:—</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>“In the 16th year of K. Henry VII. John Ellam alienated it (the
seat of Ellam) to Henry Harman, who was then Clerk

and <span class="xxpn" id="p-x">{x}</span>
who likewise purchased an estate called Maystreet here, of Cowley and
Bulbeck, of Bulbeck-street in this parish, in the 20th year of King
Edward IV.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a>

these estates.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a>

his son; who, among others, procured his lands to be disgavelled, by the
act of the 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a>

<p>The excellent parson, William Harrison, in his ‘Description of
England,’ prefixed to Holinshed’s Chronicles (edit. 1586), quotes
Harman fairly enough in his chapter “Of prouision made for the
poore,” Book II, chap. 10.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a>
And as he gives a statement of the
sharp punishment enacted for idle rogues and vagabonds by the
Statutes of Elizabeth, I take a long extract from his said chapter.
After speaking of those who are made ‘beggers through other mens
occasion,’ and denouncing the grasping landlords ‘who make them
so, and wipe manie out of their occupiengs,’ Harrison goes on to
those who are beggars ‘through their owne default’ (p. 183, last line
of col. 1, ed. 1586):</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>“Such as are idle beggers through their owne default are
of two sorts, and continue their estates either by casuall
or meere voluntarie meanes: those that are such by casuall
means <span class="nowrap"><a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a>†are</span>
in the beginning† iustlie to be referred either to the first
or second sort of poore †afore mentioned†; but, degenerating
into the thriftlesse sort, they doo what they can to continue
their miserie; and, with such impediments as they haue, to
straie and wander about, as creatures abhorring all labour and
euerie honest excercise. Certes, I call these casuall meanes,
not in respect of the originall of their pouertie, but of the
continuance of the same, from whence they will not be deliuered,
such<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a> is
their owne vngratious lewdnesse and froward disposition. The
voluntarie meanes proceed from outward causes, as by making of
corosiues, and applieng the same to the more fleshie parts of
their bodies; and also laieng of ratsbane, sperewort, crowfoot,
and such like vnto their whole members, thereby to raise
pitifull<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a>
and odious sores, and mooue †the harts of† the goers by such
places where they lie, to <a class="afnanc" href="#fn19"
id="fnanc19">19</a>‡yerne at‡ their miserie, and therevpon†
bestow large almesse vpon them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn20"
id="fnanc20">20</a> How artificiallie they beg, what forcible
speech, and how they select and choose out words of vehemencie,
whereby they doo in maner coniure or adiure the goer by to
pitie their cases, I passe ouer to remember, as iudging the
name of God and Christ to be more conuersant in the mouths of
none, and yet the presence of the heuenlie maiestie further off
from no men than from this vngratious companie. Which maketh
me to thinke, that punishment is farre meeter for them than
liberalitie or almesse, and sith Christ willeth vs cheeflie to
haue a regard to himselfe and his poore members.</p>

<p>“Vnto this nest is another sort to be referred, more sturdie than the
rest, which, hauing sound and perfect lims, doo
yet, notwithstanding <span class="xxpn" id="p-xii">{xii}</span>
sometime counterfeit the possession of all sorts of diseases. Diuerse
times in their apparell also<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a>
they will be like seruing men or laborers:
oftentimes they can plaie the mariners, and seeke for ships which they
neuer lost.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a>
But, in fine, they are all theeues and caterpillers in the
commonwealth, and, by the word of God not permitted to eat, sith they
doo but licke the sweat from the true laborers’ browes, <i>and</i> beereue the
godlie poore of that which is due vnto them, to mainteine their excesse,
consuming the charitie of well-disposed people bestowed vpon them,
after a most wicked<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a>
<i>and</i> detestable maner.</p>

<p>“It is not yet full threescore <a class="afnanc" href="#fn24"
id="fnanc24">24</a> yeares since this trade began: but how
it hath prospered since that time, it is easie to iudge; for
they are now supposed, of one sex and another, to amount vnto
aboue 10,000 persons, as I haue heard reported. Moreouer, in
counterfeiting the Egyptian roges, they haue deuised a language
among themselues, which they name <i>Canting</i> (but other pedlers
French)—a speach compact thirtie yeares since of English, and
a great number of od words of their owne deuising, without all
order or reason: and yet such is it as none but themselues are
able to vnderstand. The first deuiser thereof was hanged by the
necke,—a iust reward, no doubt, for his deserts, and a <span
class="spsidenote">Thomas Harman.</span> common end to all of
that profession. A gentleman, also, of late hath taken great
paines to search out the secret practises of this vngratious
rabble. And among other things he setteth downe and describeth

<p>Among the users of Harman’s book, the chief and coolest was the
author of <i>The groundworke of Conny-catching</i>, 1592, who wrote a
few introductory pages, and then quietly reprinted almost all Harman’s
book with an ‘I leaue you now vnto those which by Maister
Harman are discouered’ (p. <a href="#p103" title="go to page 103">103</a>, below). By this time Harman was
no doubt dead.—Who will search for his Will in the Wills Office?—Though
Samuel Rowlands was alive, he did not show up this early
appropriator of Harman’s work as he did a later one. As a kind of
Supplement to the <i>Caueat</i>, I have added, as the 4th tract in the
present volume, such parts of the <i>Groundworke of Conny-catching</i> as
are not reprinted from Harman. The <i>Groundworke</i> has been attributed
to Robert Greene, but on no evidence (I believe) except
Greene’s having written a book in three Parts on Conny-catching,
1591–2, and ‘A Disputation betweene a Hee Conny-catcher and a
Shee Conny-catcher, whether a Theafe or a Whore is most hvrtfull
in Cousonage to the Common-wealth,’ 1592.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn33" id="fnanc33">33</a>
Hearne’s copy of the
<i>Groundworke</i> is bound up in the 2nd vol. of Greene’s Works, among
George III.’s books in the British Museum, as if it really was
Greene’s.</p>

<p>Another pilferer from Harman was Thomas Dekker, in his <i>Belman
of London</i>, 1608, of which three editions were published in the
same year (<i>Hazlitt</i>). But Samuel Rowlands found him out and
showed him up. From the fifth edition of the Belman, the earliest
that our copier, Mr W. M. Wood, could find in the British Museum,
he has drawn up the following account of the book:</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p class="phanga"><i>The Belman of London. Bringing to Light the most notorious Villanies
that are now practiced in the Kingdome. Profitable for Gentlemen,

<p>On the back of the title-page, after the table of contents, the
eleven following ‘secret villanies’ are described, severally, as</p>

</ul></div>

<p>After a short description of the four ages of the world, there is an
account of a feast, at which were present all kinds of vagabonds.
Dekker was conveyed, by ‘an old nimble-tong’d beldam, who seemed
to haue the command of the place,’ to an upper loft, ‘where, vnseene,
I might, through a wooden Latice that had prospect of the dining
roome, both see and heare all that was to be done or spoken.’</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>‘The whole assembly being thus gathered together, one, amongest
the rest, who tooke vpon him a Seniority ouer the rest, charged euery
man to answer to his name, to see if the Iury were full:—the Bill by
which hee meant to call them beeing a double Iug of ale (that had the
spirit of <i>Aquavitæ</i> in it, it smelt so strong), and that hee held in his hand.
Another, standing by, with a toast, nutmeg, and ginger, ready to cry <i>Vous
avez</i> as they were cald, and all that were in the roome hauing single pots
by the eares, which, like Pistols, were charged to goe off so soone as euer
they heard their names. This Ceremony beeing set abroach, an Oyes was
made. But he that was Rector Chory (the Captain of the Tatterdemalions)
spying one to march vnder his Colours, that had neuer before serued in
those lowsie warres, paused awhile (after hee had taken his first draught,
to tast the dexterity of the liquor), and then began, Iustice-like, to
examine this yonger brother vpon interrogatories.’</p></div>

<p>This yonger brother is afterwards ‘stalled to the rogue;’ and the
‘Rector Chory<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34" id="fnanc34">34</a>&#x202f;’
instructs him in his duties, and tells him the names
and degrees of the fraternity of vagabonds. Then comes the feast,
after which, ‘one who tooke vpon him to be speaker to the whole
house,’ began, as was the custom of their meeting, ‘to make an
oration in praise of Beggery, and of those that professe the trade,’
which done, all the company departed, leaving the ‘old beldam’ and
Dekker the only occupants of the room.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc34" id="fn34">34</a>
Leader of the Choir, Captain of the Company.</p></div>

<div class="dblkquot">
<p>‘The spirit of her owne mault walkt in her brain-pan, so that, what
with the sweetnes of gaines which shee had gotten
by her Marchant <span class="xxpn" id="p-xvi">{xvi}</span>
Venturers, and what with the fumes of drinke, which set her tongue in
going, I found her apt for talke; and, taking hold of this opportunity,
after some intreaty to discouer to mee what these vpright men, rufflers
and the rest were, with their seuerall qualities and manners of life,
Thus shee began.’</p></div>

<p>And what she tells Dekker is taken, all of it, from Harman’s
book.</p>

<p>Afterwards come accounts of the five ‘Laws’ and five jumps at
leap-frog mentioned on the back of the title-page, and which is
quoted above, p. <a href="#p-xv" title="go to page xv">xv.</a></p>

<p>Lastly ‘A short Discourse of Canting,’ which is, entirely, taken
from Harman, pages <a href="#p084" title="go to page 84">84</a>–87, below.</p>

<p>As I have said before, Dekker was shown up for his pilferings
from Harman by Samuel Rowlands, who must, says Mr Collier in his
Bibliographical Catalogue, have published his <i>Martin Mark-all,
Beadle of Bridewell</i>, in or before 1609,—though no edition is known
to us before 1610,—because Dekker in an address ‘To my owne
Nation’ in his <i>Lanthorne and Candle-light</i>, which was published in
1609, refers to Rowlands as a ‘Beadle of Bridewell.’ ‘You shall
know him,’ (says Dekker, speaking of a rival author, [that is, Samuel
Rowlands] whom he calls ‘a Usurper’) ‘by his Habiliments, for (by
the furniture he weares) hee will bee taken for <i>a Beadle of Bridewell</i>.’
That this ‘Usurper’ was Rowlands, we know by the latter’s
saying in <i>Martin Mark-all</i>, leaf E, i back,
‘although he (the Bel-man,
that is, Dekker) is bold to call me an <i>vsurper</i>; for so he doth in his
last round.’</p>

<p>Well, from this treatise of Rowlands’, Mr Wood has made the
following extracts relating to Dekker and Harman, together with
Rowlands’s own list of slang words not in Dekker or Harman, and
‘the errour in his [Dekker’s] words, and true englishing of the
same:’</p>

<p class="padtopc">‘Martin Mark-all, his Apologie to the Bel-man of London. There
hath been of late dayes great paines taken on the part of the good old
Bel-man of London, in discouering, as hee thinks, a new-found Nation
and People. Let it be so for this time: hereupon much adoe was made
in setting forth their liues, order of liuing, method of speech, and vsuall
meetings, with diuers other things thereunto appertaining. These
volumes and papers, now spread euerie where, so that euerie Iacke-boy
now can say as well as the proudest of that fraternitie, “will you wapp for
a wyn, or tranie for a make?” The gentle Company of Cursitours began
now to stirre, and looke about them; and hauing gathered together a
Conuocation of Canting Caterpillars, as wel in the North parts at the
Diuels arse apeake,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnanc35">35</a>
as in the South, they diligently enquired, and
straight search was made, whether any had reuolted from that faithles
fellowship. Herupon euery one gaue his verdict: some supposed that
it might be some one that, hauing ventured to farre beyond wit and
good taking heede, was fallen into the hands of the Magistrate, and
carried to the trayning Cheates, where, in shew of a penitent heart, and
remoarse of his good time ill spent, turned the cocke, and let out all:
others thought it might be some spie-knaue that, hauing little to doe,
tooke vpon him the habite and forme of an Hermite; and so, by dayly
commercing and discoursing, learned in time the mysterie and knowlege
of this ignoble profession: and others, because it smelt of a study,
deemed it to be some of their owne companie, that had been at some
free-schoole, and belike, because hee would be handsome against a good
time, tooke pen and inke, and wrote of that subiect; thus, <i>Tot homines,
tot sententiæ</i>, so many men, so many mindes. And all because the spightfull
Poet would not set too his name. At last vp starts an old Cacodemicall
Academicke with his frize bonnet, and giues them al to know,
that this invectiue was set foorth, made, and printed Fortie yeeres agoe.
And being then called, ‘A caueat for Cursitors,’ is now newly printed,
and termed, ‘The Bel-man of London,’ made at first by one Master Harman,
a Iustice of Peace in Kent, in Queene Marie’s daies,—he being then
about ten yeeres of age.’ Sign. A. 2.</p>

<p>‘They (the vagabonds) haue a language among themselues, composed
of <i>omnium gatherum</i>; a glimering whereof, one of late daies hath
endeuoured to manifest, as farre as his Authour
is pleased to be an <span class="xxpn" id="p-xviii">{xviii}</span>
intelligencer. The substance whereof he leaueth for those that will dilate
thereof; enough for him to haue the praise, other the paines, notwithstanding
<i>Harman’s</i> ghost continually clogging his conscience with <i>Sic
Vos non Vobis</i>.’—Sign. C. 3 back.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn36" id="fnanc36">36</a></p>

<p>‘Because the Bel-man entreateth any that is more rich in canting,
to lend him better or more with variety, he will repay his loue double,
I haue thought good, not only to shew his errour in some places in setting
downe olde wordes vsed fortie yeeres agoe, before he was borne, for

Of the above passages, Dekker speaks in the following
manner:—“There is an Vsurper, that of late hath taken vpon him the
name of the Belman; but being not able to maintaine that title, hee
doth now call himselfe the Bel-mans brother; his ambition is (rather
out of vaine-glory then the true courage of an experienced Souldier)
to haue the leading of the Van; but it shall be honor good enough for
him (if not too good) to come vp with the Rere. You shall know him by
his Habiliments, for (by the furniture he weares) he will be taken for
a <i>Beadle of Bridewell</i>. It is thought he is rather a Newter then a
friend to the cause: and therefore the Bel-man doth here openly protest
that hee comes into the field as no fellow in armes with him.”—<i>O per
se O</i> (1612 edit.), sign. A. 2.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<p>In the second Part of his <i>Belman of London</i>, namely, his
<i>Lanthorne and Candle-light</i>, 1609, Dekker printed a Dictionary of
Canting, which is only a reprint of Harman’s (p. <a href="#p082" title="go to page 82">82</a>–4, below). A
few extracts from this <i>Lanthorne</i> are subjoined:</p>

<div class="dblkquot">
<div><i>Canting.</i></div>

<p>“This word <i>canting</i> seemes to bee deriued from the latine <i>verbe
canto</i>, which signifies in English, to sing, or to make a sound with
words,—that is to say, to speake. And very aptly may <i>canting</i> take his
deriuation, a <i>cantando</i>, from singing, because, amongst these beggerly
consorts that can play vpon no better instruments, the language of
<i>canting</i> is a kind of musicke; and he that in such
assemblies can <i>cant</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p-xx">{xx}</span>

<p>Richard Head (says Mr Hotten), in his <i>English Rogue, described
in the Life of Meriton Latroon, a Witty Extravagant</i>, 4 vols. 12mo.,
1671–80, gave “a glossary of Cant words ‘used by the Gipsies’; but
it was only a reprint of what Decker had given sixty years before,”
and therefore merely taken from Harman too. ‘The Bibliography
of Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Language’ has been given so fully at the
end of Mr Hotten’s Slang Dictionary, that I excuse myself from
pursuing the subject farther. I only add here Mr Wood’s extracts
from four of the treatises on this subject not noticed by Mr Hotten
in the 1864 edition of his Dictionary, but contained (with others) in
a most curious volume in the British Museum, labelled <i>Practice of
Robbers</i>,—Press Mark 518. h. 2.,—as also some of the slang words in

<div class="section">
<p class="padtopa">The third piece in the present volume is a larky Sermon in
praise of Thieves and Thievery, the title of which
(p. <a href="#p093" title="go to page 93">93</a>, below)
happened to catch my eye when I was turning over the Cotton
Catalogue, and which was printed here, as well from its suiting
the subject, as from a pleasant recollection of a gallop some 30
years ago in a four-horse coach across Harford-Bridge-Flat, where
Parson Haben (or Hyberdyne), who is said to have preached the
Sermon, was no doubt robbed. My respected friend Goody-goody
declares the sermon to be ‘dreadfully irreverent;’ but one needn’t
mind him. An earlier copy than the Cotton one turned up among
the Lansdowne MSS, and as it differed a good deal from the Cotton
text, it has been printed opposite to that.</p>

<p>Of the fourth piece in this little volume, <i>The Groundworke of
Conny-catching</i>, less its reprint from Harman, I have spoken above, at
p. <a href="#p-xiv" title="go to page xiv">xiv.</a> There was no good
in printing the whole of it, as we should then have had Harman twice
over.</p>

<hr class="hr30" />

<p>The growth of the present Text was on this wise: Mr Viles
suggested a reprint of Stace’s reprint of Harman in 1573, after it had
been read with the original, and collated with the earlier editions.
The first edition I could not find, but ascertained, with some trouble,
and through Mr H. C. Hazlitt, where the second and third editions
were, and borrowed the 3rd of its ever-generous owner, Mr Henry
Huth. Then Mr Hazlitt told me of Awdeley, which he thought was
borrowed from Harman. However, Harman’s own words soon
settled that point; and Awdeley had to precede Harman. Then
the real bagger from Harman, the <i>Groundworke</i>, had to be added,
after the Parson’s Sermon. Mr Viles read the proofs and revises
of Harman with the original: Mr Wood and I have made the Index;
and I, because Mr Viles is more desperately busy than myself, have
written the Preface.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>The extracts from Mr J. P. Collier must be taken for what they
are worth. I have not had time to verify them; but assume them to
be correct, and not ingeniously or unreasonably altered from their
originals, like Mr Collier’s print of Henslowe’s
Memorial, of which <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxv">{xxv}</span>
Dr Ingleby complains,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnanc38">38</a>
and like his notorious Alleyn letter. If some
one only would follow Mr Collier through all his work—pending his
hoped-for Retractations,—and assure us that the two pieces above-named,
and the Perkins Folio, are the only things we need reject,
such some-one would render a great service to all literary antiquarians,
and enable them to do justice to the wonderful diligence,
knowledge, and acumen, of the veteran pioneer in their path. Certainly,
in most of the small finds which we workers at this Text
thought we had made, we afterwards found we had been anticipated
by Mr Collier’s <i>Registers of the Stationers’ Company</i>, or <i>Bibliographical
Catalogue</i>, and that the facts were there
rightly stated. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxvi">{xxvi}</span>
That there is pure metal in Mr Collier’s work, and a good deal
of it, few will doubt; but the dross needs refining out. I hope
that the first step in the process may be the printing of the whole
of the Stationers’ Registers from their start to 1700 at least, by the
Camden Society,—within whose range this work well lies,—or by
the new Harleian or some other Society. It ought not to be left
to the ‘Early English Text’ to do some 20 years hence.</p>

To obviate the possibility of mistake in the lection of this curious document,
Mr E. W. Ashbee has, at my request, and by permission of the Governors
of Dulwich College (where the paper is preserved), furnished me with an exact
fac-simile of it, worked off on somewhat similar paper. By means of this fac-simile
my readers may readily assure themselves that in no part of the memorial
is Lodge called a “player;” indeed he is not called “Thos. Lodge,”
and it is only an inference, an unavoidable conclusion, that the Lodge here
spoken of is Thomas Lodge, the dramatist. Mr Collier, however, professes to
find that he is there called “Thos. Lodge,” and that it [the Memorial] contains
this remarkable grammatical inversion;</p>

<div class="dfn38">
<p class="pcontinue">“and haveinge some knowledge and acquaintaunce of him as a player,
requested me to be his baile,”</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">which is evidently intended to mean, <i>as I had some knowledge and acquaintance
of Lodge as a player, he requested me to be his baile</i>. But in this place
the original paper reads thus,</p>

<div class="dfn38">
<p class="pcontinue">“and havinge of me some knowledge and acquaintnunce requested me
to be his bayle,”</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">meaning, of course, <i>Lodge, having some knowledge and acquaintance of me,
requested me to be his bail</i>.</p>

<p>The interpolation of the five words needed to corroborate Mr Collier’s
explanation of the misquoted passage from Gosson, and the omission of two
other words inconsistent with that interpolation, may be thought to exhibit
some little ingenuity; it was, however, a feat which could have cost him no
great pains. But the labour of recasting the orthography of the memorial
must have been considerable; while it is difficult to imagine a rational motive
to account for such labour being incurred. To expand the abbreviations and
modernize the orthography might have been expedient, as it would have been
easy. But, in the name of reason, what is the gain of writing <i>wheare</i> and
<i>theare</i> for “where” and “there;” <i>cleere</i>, <i>yeeld</i>, and <i>meerly</i> for “clere,”
“yealde,” and “merely;” <i>verie</i>, <i>anie</i>, <i>laie</i>, <i>waie</i>, <i>paie</i>, <i>yssue</i>, and <i>pryvily</i>, for
“very,” “any,” “lay,” “way,” “pay,” “issue,” and “privylie;” <i>sondrie</i>, <i>begon</i>,
and <i>doen</i> for “sundrie,” “began,” and “don;” and <i>thintent</i>, <i>thaction</i>, and

<i>Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, and her parish.</i>
The manor of Erith was granted to Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury,
by Henry VIII. in the 36th year of his reign, <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1544–5. The Countess
died in 1567, and was buried in the parish church of Erith. “The
manor of Eryth becoming part of the royal revenue, continued in the
crown till K. Henry VIII. in his 36th year, granted it in fee to Elizabeth,
relict of George, Earl of Shrewsbury, by the description of the <i>manor,
of Eryth, alias Lysnes</i>, with all its members and appurts., and also all
that wood, called Somersden, lying in Eryth, containing 30 acres; and a
wood, called Ludwood, there, containing 50 acres; and a wood, called
Fridayes-hole, by estimation, 20 acres, to hold of the King <i>in capite</i> by
knight’s service.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn39" id="fnanc39">39</a>

who died July 26, anno 33 K. Henry VIII.,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn41" id="fnanc41">41</a>
by whom she had issue one son, John, who died young; and Anne,
married to Peter Compton, son and heir of Sir Wm. Compton, Knt., who
died in the 35th year of K. Henry VIII., under age, as will be mentioned
hereafter. Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, in Easter Term, in the
4th year of Q. Elizabeth, levied a fine of this manor, with the passage
over the Thames; and dying in the tenth year of that reign, anno 1567,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnanc42">42</a>
lies buried under a sumptuous tomb, in this church. Before her death
this manor, &amp;c., seem to have been settled on her only daughter Anne,
then wife of Wm. Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and widow of Peter
Compton, as before related, who was in possession of it, with the passage
over the Thames, anno 9 Q. Elizabeth.”—Hasted’s <i>History of Kent</i>, vol.

lane, so called, not only of <i>a sign of three cranes at a tavern door</i>, but
rather of three strong cranes of timber placed on the Vintry wharf by
the Thames side, to crane up wines there, as is afore showed. This
lane was of old time, to wit, the 9th of Richard II., called The Painted
Tavern lane, of the tavern being painted.”—Stow’s <i>Survey of London</i>,
ed. by Thoms, p. 90.</p>

<p>“The Three Cranes was formerly a favourite London sign. With
the usual jocularity of our forefathers, an opportunity for punning could
not be passed; so, instead of the three cranes, which in the vintry used
to lift the barrels of wine, three birds were represented. The Three Cranes
in Thames Street, or in the vicinity, was a famous tavern as early as the
reign of James I. It was one of the taverns frequented by the wits in
Ben Jonson’s time. In one of his plays he says:—</p>

<p>‘A pox o’ these pretenders! to wit, your <i>Three Cranes</i>, Mitre and Mermaid
men! not a corn of true salt, not a grain of right mustard among
them all!’—<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, act i. sc. 1.</p>

Pepys suffered a strong mortification
of the flesh in having to dine at this tavern with some poor relations.
The sufferings of the snobbish secretary must have been intense:—</p>

<p>‘By invitation to my uncle Fenner’s, and where I found his new
wife, a <i>pitiful, old, ugly, ill-bred</i> woman in a hatt, a mid-wife. Here
were many of his, and as many of her, relations, <i>sorry, mean people</i>; and
after choosing our gloves, we all went over to the
Three Cranes Taverne: <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxvix">{xxvix}</span>
and though the best room of the house, in such a narrow dogghole we
were crammed, and I believe we were near 40, that it made me loath my
company and victuals, and a very poor dinner it was too.’</p>

bridge, walking round to Billingsgate, where they would reenter them.”—Hotten’s

Isleworth,’ says Walker’s Gazetteer, ed. 1801. That there might well
have been a St Julyan’s Inn there we learn from the following extract:</p>

<p>“St. Julian, the patron of travellers, wandering minstrels, boatmen,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnanc43">43</a>
&amp;c., was a very common inn sign, because he was supposed to provide
good lodgings for such persons. Hence two St Julian’s crosses, in
saltier, are in chief of the innholders’ arms, and the old motto was:—‘When
I was harbourless, ye lodged me.’ This benevolent attention to
travellers procured him the epithet of ‘the good herbergeor,’ and in
France ‘<i>bon herbet</i>.’ His legend in a MS., Bodleian, 1596, fol. 4, alludes
to this:—</p>

common field, extending between Chesterton and Cambridge, near the
little brook Sture, for about half a mile square, is noted for its fair, which
is kept annually on September 19th, and continues a fortnight. It is
surpassed by few fairs in Great Britain, or even in Europe, for traffic,
though of late it is much lessened. The booths are placed in rows like
streets, by the name[s] of which they are called, as Cheapside, &amp;c., and
are filled with all sorts of trades. The Duddery, an area of 80 or 100
yards square, resembles Blackwell Hall. Large commissions are negotiated
here for all parts of England in <i>cheese</i>, woolen goods, wool,
leather, hops, upholsterers’ and ironmongers’ ware, &amp;c. &amp;c. Sometimes
50 hackney coaches from London, ply morning and night, to and from
Cambridge, as well as all the towns round, and the very barns and
stables are turned into inns for the accommodation of the poorer people.
After the wholesale business is over, the country gentry generally flock
in, laying out their money in stage-plays, taverns, music-houses, toys,
puppet-shows, &amp;c., and the whole concludes with a day for the sale of
horses. This fair is under the jurisdiction of the University of Cambridge.—<i>Walker’s

<h4 title="A CURTESY MAN">¶ A CURTESY MAN.</h4>

<p>A Curtesy man is one that walketh about the back lanes in
London in the day time, and sometime in the broade streetes in the
night season, and when he meeteth some handsome yong man clenly
apareled, or some other honest Citizen, he maketh humble salutatio<i>n</i>s
and low curtesy, and sheweth him that he hath a worde or two
to speake with his mastership. This child can behaue him selfe
manerly, for he wyll desire him that he talketh withall, to take the
vpper hand, and shew him much reuerence, and at last like his
familier acquaintaunce will put on his cap, and walke syde by syde,
and talke on this fashion: Oh syr, you seeme to be a man, and one
that fauoureth men, and therefore I am the more bolder to breake
my mind vnto your good maistership. Thus it is syr, ther is a certaine
of vs (though I say it both taule and handsome men of theyr
hands) which haue come lately from the wars, and as God knoweth
haue nothing to take to, being both maisterles and moniles, &amp; knowing
no way wherby to yerne one peny. And further, wher as we
haue bene welthely brought vp, and we also haue beene had in good
estimatio<i>n</i>, we are a shamed now to declare our misery, and to fall
a crauing as common Beggers, and as for to steale and robbe, (God is
our record) it striketh vs to <span class="spleaf">[leaf 4]</span> the hart, to thinke of such a
mischiefe, that euer any handsome man should
fall into such a <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
daunger for thys worldly trash. Which if we had to suffise our
want and necessity, we should neuer seeke thus shamefastly to craue
on such good pityfull men as you seeme to be, neither yet so daungerously
to hasarde our liues for so vyle a thing. Therefore good syr,
as you seeme to be a handsome man your selfe, and also such a one
as pitieth the miserable case of handsome men, as now your eyes
and countenaunce sheweth to haue some pity vppon this my miserable
complainte: So in Gods cause I require your maistershyp, &amp; in
the behalfe of my poore afflicted fellowes, which though here in sight
they cry not with me to you, yet wheresouer they bee, I am sure
they cry vnto God to moue the heartes of some good men to shew
forth their liberality in this behalfe. All which &amp; I with them craue
now the same request at your good masterships hand. With these or
such like words he frameth his talke. Now if the party (which he
thus talketh withall) profereth hym a peny or .ii.d. he taketh it, but
verye scornfully, and at last speaketh on this sorte: Well syr, your
good will is not to be refused. But yet you shall vnderstand (good
syr) that this is nothing for them, for whom I do thus shamefastly
entreate. Alas syr, it is not a groate or .xii.d. I speake for, being
such a company of Seruiters as wee haue bene: yet neuertheles God
forbid I should not receiue your ge<i>n</i>tle offer at this time, hoping
hereafter through your good motions to some such lyke good gentleman
as you be, that I, or some of my fellowes in my place, shall
finde the more liberality. These kind of ydle Vacabondes wyll go
commonly well appareled, without <span class="spleaf">[leaf 4 <i>b</i>.]</span> any weapon, and in
place where they meete together, as at their hosteryes or other places,
they wyll beare the port of ryght good gentlemen, &amp; some are the
more trusted, but co<i>m</i>monly thei pay them w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> stealing a paire of
sheetes, or Couerlet, &amp; so take their farewell earely in the morning,
before the mayster or dame be sturring.</p>

<h4 title="A CHEATOUR OR FINGERER">¶ A CHEATOUR OR FINGERER.</h4>

<p>These commonly be such kinde of idle Vacabondes as scarcely a
man shall discerne, they go so gorgeously, sometime with waiting
men, and sometime without. Their trade is to walke in such places,
where as gentelmen &amp; other worshipfull
Citizens do resorte, as at <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
Poules, or at Christes Hospital, &amp; somtime at y<i>e</i> Royal exchaunge.
These haue very many acquaintaunces, yea, and for the most part will
acquaint them selues with euery man, and fayne a society, in one
place or other. But chiefly they wil seeke their acquaintaunce of
such (which they haue learned by diligent enquiring where they resort)
as haue receyued some porcioun of money of their friends, as
yong Gentlemen which are sent to London to study the lawes, or els
some yong Marchant man or other kynde of Occupier, whose friendes
hath geuen them a stock of mony<a class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnanc45">45</a>
to occupy withall. When they
haue thus found out such a pray, they will find the meanes by theyr
familiarity, as very curteously to bid him to breakefast at one place
or other, where they are best acquainted, and closely amonge themselues
wil appoint one of their Fraternity, which they call a Fyngerer,
an olde beaten childe, not onely in such deceites, but also such
a one as by his age is painted out with gray heares, wrinkled face,
crooked back, and most commonly lame, as it might seeme with age,
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 5]</span> yea and such a one as to shew a simplicity, shal weare a
homely cloke and hat scarce worth .vi. d. This nimble fingred
knight (being appointed to this place) co<i>m</i>meth in as one not
knowen of these Cheatours, but as vnwares shal sit down at the end
of the bord where they syt, &amp; call for his peny pot of wine, or a
pinte of Ale, as the place serueth. Thus sitting as it were alone,
mumblyng on a crust, or some such thing, these other yonckers wil
finde some kind of mery talke with him, some times questioning
wher he dwelleth, &amp; sometimes enquiring what trade he vseth, which
co<i>m</i>monly he telleth them he vseth husbandry: &amp; talking thus
merely, at last they aske him, how sayest thou, Father, wylt thou play
for thy breakfast with one of vs, that we may haue some pastime as
we syt? Thys olde Karle makyng it straunge at the first saith: My
maysters, ich am an old man, and halfe blinde, and can skyl of very
few games, yet for that you seeme to be such good Gentelmen, as to
profer to play for that of which you had no part, but onely I my
selfe, and therefore of right ich am worthy to pay for it, I shal with
al my hart fulfyl your request. And so falleth to play, somtime at
Cardes, &amp; sometime at dice. Which through his
cou<i>n</i>terfait simplicity <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
in the play somtimes ouer counteth himself, or playeth somtimes
against his wyl, so as he would not, &amp; then counterfaiteth to be
angry, and falleth to swearing, &amp; so leesing that, profereth to play for
a shillyng or two. The other therat hauing good sport, seming to
mocke him, falleth againe to play, and so by their legerdemane, &amp;
cou<i>n</i>terfaiting, winneth ech of them a shilling or twain, &amp; at last
whispereth the yong man in the eare to play with hym also, that
ech one might haue a fling at him. <span class="spleaf">[leaf 5&#x2060;<i>b</i>.]</span> This yong ma<i>n</i> for
company falleth againe to play also with the sayd Fyngerer, and winneth
as the other did which when he had loste a noble or .vi. s.
maketh as though he had lost al his mony, and falleth a intreating
for parte thereof againe to bring him home, which the other knowing
his mind and intent, stoutely denieth and iesteth, &amp; scoffeth at
him. This Fingerer seeming then to be in a rage, desireth the<i>m</i> as
they are true gentlemen, to tarry till he fetcheth more store of money,
or els to point some place where they may meete. They seeming
greedy hereof, promiseth faithfully and clappeth handes so to meete.
They thus ticklyng the young man in the eare, willeth him to make
as much money as he can, and they wil make as much as they can,
and co<i>n</i>sent as though they wil play booty against him. But in the
ende they so vse the matter, that both the young man leeseth his
part, and, as it seemeth to him, they leesing theirs also, and so maketh
as though they would fal together by the eares with this fingerer,
which by one wyle or other at last conueyeth him selfe away, &amp; they
as it were raging lyke mad bedlams, one runneth one way, an other an
other way, leauing the loser indeede all alone. Thus these Cheatours
at their accustomed hosteries meete closely together, and there receiue
ech one his part of this their vile spoyle. Of this fraternity
there be that be called helpers, which commonly haunt tauernes or
alehouses, and co<i>m</i>meth in as men not acquainted with none in the
companye, but spying them at any game, wil byd them God spede
and God be at their game, and will so place him selfe that he will
shew his fellow by sygnes and tokens, without speech commonly, but
sometime with far fetched <span class="spleaf">[leaf 6]</span> wordes, what cardes he hath in
his hand, and how he may play against him. And those betwene
the<i>m</i> both getteth money out of the others purse.</p>

<h4 title="A RING FALLER">¶ A RING FALLER.</h4>

<p>A Ryng faller is he that getteth fayre copper rings, some made like
signets, &amp; some after other fashio<i>n</i>s, very faire gylded, &amp; walketh vp
and down the streetes, til he spieth some man of the country, or
some other simple body whom he thinketh he may deceaue, and so
goeth a lyttle before him or them, and letteth fall one of these
ringes, which when the party that commeth after spieth and taketh
it vp, he hauing an eye backward, crieth halfe part, the party that
taketh it vp, thinking it to be of great value, profereth him some
money for his part, which he not fully denieth, but willeth him to
come into some alehouse or tauerne, and there they will common
vpon the matter. Which when they come in, and are set in some
solitary place (as commonly they call for such a place) there he desireth
the party that found the ring to shew it him. When he seeth
it, he falleth a entreating the party that found it, and desireth him
to take money for his part, and telleth him that if euer he may do
him any frendship hereafter he shal commaund him, for he maketh
as though he were very desirous to haue it. The symple man seeing
him so importune vpon it, thinketh the ring to bee of great valure,
and so is the more lother to part from it. At last this ring faller
asketh him what he will geue him for his part, for, saith he, seeing
you wyl not let me haue the ring, alowe me my part, and take you
the ring. The other asketh what he counteth the ring to be worth,
he answereth, v. or vi. pound. No, saith he, it is not so much
worth. <span class="spleaf">[leaf 6 <i>b</i>.]</span> Well (saith this Ringfaller) let me haue it, and I
wyll alow you .xl. s. for your part. The other party standyng in a
doubt, and looking on the ryng, asketh if he wyll geue the money
out of hand. The other answereth, he hath not so much ready
mony about him, but he wil go fetch so much for him, if he wil go
with him. The other that found the ring, thinking he meaneth truly,
beginneth to profer him .xx. s. for his part, sometymes more, or les,
which he verye scornfullye refuseth at the first, and styl entreateth
that he might haue the ring, which maketh the other more fonder of
it, and desireth him to take the money for his part, &amp; so profereth
him money. This ring faller seing y<sup>e</sup> mony, maketh it very strau<i>n</i>ge,
and first questioneth with him wher he dwelleth,
and asketh him <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
what is his name, &amp; telleth him that he semeth to be an honest
man, and therfore he wil do somwhat for friendships sake, hoping to
haue as friendly a pleasure at his hand hereafter, and so profereth
hym for .x. s. more he should haue the ryng. At last, with entreatye
on both partes, he geueth the Ring faller the money, and so departeth,
thinkyng he hath gotten a very great Iewell. These kynde of
deceyuing Vacabondes haue other practises with their rings, as somtimes
to come to buy wares of mens Prentesies, and somtimes of their
Maisters, and when he hath agreed of the price, he sayth he hath not
so much money about him, but pulleth of one of these rings of from
his fyngers, and profereth to leaue it in pawne, tyl his Maister or
his friendes hath sene it, so promising to bring the money, the seller
thinking he meaneth truly, letteth him go, and neuer seeth him after,
tyll perhaps at Tyburne or at such lyke place. Ther is another kinde
of <span class="spleaf">[leaf 7]</span> these Ring choppers, which co<i>m</i>monly cary about them a
faire gold ring in deede, and these haue other counterfait rings made
so lyke this gold ring, as ye shal not perceiue the contrary, tyl it be
brought to y<sup>e</sup> touchstone. This child wyl come to borow mony of
the right gold ring, the party mistrusting the Ring not to be good,
goeth to the Goldsmith with the partye that hath the ryng, and
tryeth it whether it be good golde, and also wayeth it to know how
much it is worth. The Goldsmith tryeth it to be good gold, and also
to haue hys ful weight like gold, and warenteth the party which shall
lend the money that the ring is worth so much money according to
the waight, this yoncker comming home with the party which shall
lend the money, and hauing the gold ring againe, putteth vp the
gold ring, and pulleth out a counterfaite ring very like the same, &amp;
so deliuereth it to the party which lendeth the money, they thinking
it to be the same which they tryed, and so deliuereth the money or
sometimes wares, and thus
vily be deceiued.</p>

of Auncient and longe tyme there hath bene, and is now at
this present, many good, godly, profitable lawes and actes
made and setforthe in this most noble and floryshynge realme,
for the reliefe, succour, comforte, and sustentacion of the
poore, nedy, impotent, and myserable creatures beinge and
inhabiting in all parts of the same; So is there (ryghte honorable
and myne especyall good Lady) most holsom estatutes, ordinances,
and necessary lawes, made, setforth, and publisshed, for the
extreme punishement of all vagarantes and sturdy vacabons, as passeth
throughe and by all parts of this famous yle, most idelly and
wyckedly: and I wel, by good experience, vnderstandinge and consideringe
your most tender, pytyfull, gentle, and noble nature,—not
onelye hauinge a vygelant and mercifull eye to your poore, indygente,
and feable parishnores; yea, not onely in the parishe where your
honour moste happely doth dwell, but also in others inuyroninge or
nighe adioyning to the same; As also aboundantly powringe out dayely
your ardent and bountifull charytie vppon all such as commeth for reliefe
vnto your luckly <span class="nowrap">gates,—</span></p>

<p>I thought it good, necessary, and my bounden dutye, to acquaynte
your goodnes with the abhominable, wycked, and detestable behauor
of all these rowsey, ragged rabblement of rakehelles, that—vnder the
pretence of great misery, dyseases, and
other innumerable calamites <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
whiche they fayne—through great hipocrisie do wyn and gayne great
almes in all places where they wyly wander, to the vtter deludinge of
the good geuers, deceauinge and impouerishing of all such poore housholders,
both sicke and sore, as nether can or maye walke abroad for
reliefe and comforte (where, in dede, most mercy is to be shewed).
And for that I (most honorable Lady), beinge placed as a poore gentleman,
haue kepte a house these twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty
dayely hath and doth repayre, not without some reliefe, as my poore
callinge and habylytie maye and doth extende: I haue of late yeares
gathered a great suspition that all should not be well, and, as the
prouerbe saythe, “sume thinge lurke and laye hyd that dyd not
playnely apeare;” for I, hauinge more occation, throughe sickenes,
to tary and remayne at home then I haue bene acustomed, do, by my
there abyding, talke <a class="afnanc" href="#fn46" id="fnanc46">46</a>and
confere dayly with many of these wyly
wanderars of both sortes, as well men and wemmen, as boyes and
gyrles, by whom I haue <span class="spleaf">[leaf 2, back]</span>
gathered and vnderstande their
depe dissimulation and detestable dealynge, beinge maruelous suttle
and craftye in there kynde, for not one amongst twenty wyll discouer,
eyther declare there scelorous secretes: yet with fayre flatteringe
wordes, money, and good chere, I haue attained to the typ by such
as the meanest of the<i>m</i> hath wandred these xiii. yeares, and most
xvi. and some twenty and upward,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn47" id="fnanc47">47</a>
and not withoute faythfull promesse
made vnto them neuer to discouer their names or any thinge
they shewed me; for they would all saye, yf the vpright men should
vnderstand thereof, they should not be only greuouslye beaten, but
put in daunger of their lyues, by the sayd vpright men. There
was a fewe yeares since a small bréefe setforth of some zelous
man to his countrey, of whom I knowe not, that made a lytle shewe
of there names and vsage, and gaue a glymsinge lyghte, not sufficient
to perswade of their peuishe peltinge and pickinge<a class="afnanc" href="#fn48" id="fnanc48">48</a>
practyses,
but well worthy of prayse. But (good madame), with nolesse
trauell then good wyll, I haue repayred and rygged the Shyp of
knowledge, and haue hoyssed vp the sayles of
good fortune, that <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
she maye safely passe aboute and through all partes of this noble
realme, and there make porte sale of her wyshed wares, to the
confusion of their drowsey demener and vnlawfull language, pylfring
pycking, wily wanderinge, and lykinge lechery, of all these
rablement of rascales that raunges about al <i>th</i>e costes of the same,
So <i>tha</i>t their vndecent, dolefull dealing and execrable exercyses
may apere to all as it were in a glasse, that therby the Iusticers
<i>and</i> Shréeues may in their circutes be more vygelant to punishe
these malefactores, and the Counstables, Bayliffes, and
bosholders,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn49" id="fnanc49">49</a>
settinge asyde all feare, slouth, <i>and</i> pytie, may be more circomspect
in executing the charg geuen them by the aforesayd Iusticers.
Then wyll no more this rascall rablement raunge about the countrey.
Then greater reliefe may be shewed to <i>th</i>e pouerty of eche parishe.
Then shall we kepe our Horses in our pastures vnstolen. Then
our lynnen clothes shall and maye lye safelye one our hedges
vntouched. Then shall we not have our clothes and lynnen hoked
out at our wyndowes as well by day as by night. Then shall we
not haue our houses broken vp in the night, as of late one of my
nyghtbors had and two great buckes of clothes stolen out, and
most of the same fyne Lynnen. Then shall we safely kepe our
pigges and poultrey from pylfring. Then shall we surely passe by
<a class="afnanc" href="#fn50" id="fnanc50">50</a><i>th</i>e
hygh waies leading to markets <i>and</i> fayres vnharmed. Then
shall our Shopes and bothes be vnpycked <i>and</i> spoyled. Then shall
these vncomly companies be dispersed and set to labour for their
lyuinge, or hastely hang for <span class="spleaf">[leaf 3]</span> their demerites. Then shall it
incourrage a great number of gentle men and others, seing this securitie,
to set vp houses and kepe hospitalytie in the countrey, to the
comfort of their nighboures, releife of the poore, and to the amendement
of the common welth. Then shall not sinne and wickednes so
much abound among vs. Then wil gods wrath be much <i>th</i>e more
pacified towards vs. Then shall we not tast of so many and sondry
plages, as now dayely raigneth ouer vs. And then shall this Famous
Empyre be in more welth <i>and</i> better florysh, to the inestymable ioye
<i>and</i> comfort of the Quenes most excelent maiestye,
whom god of his <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
infinyte goodnes, to his great glory, long and many yeares make most
prosperously to raygne ouer vs, to the great Felycitye of all the Peres
and Nobles, and to the vnspeakable ioye, releife, and quietnes of
minde, of all her faythfull Commons <i>and</i> Subiectes. Now, me
thinketh, I se how these peuysh, peruerse, and pestile<i>n</i>t people
begyn to freat, fume, sweare, and stare at this my booke, their lyfe
being layd open and aparantly paynted out, that their confusion
and end draweth one a pase. Where as in dede, if it be well
waied, it is set forth for their synguler profyt and co<i>m</i>moditie, for the
sure safegard of their lyues here in this world, that they shorten
not the same before<a class="afnanc" href="#fn51" id="fnanc51">51</a>
their time, and that by their true labour and
good lyfe, in the world to com they may saue their Soules, that
Christ, the second person in [the] Trinytie, hath so derely bought w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
his most precious bloud: so that hereby I shall do them more good
then they could haue deuised for them selues. For behold, their
lyfe being so manyfest wycked and so aparantlye knowen, The honorable
wyl abhore them, The worshipfull wyll reiecte them, The
yemen wyll sharpely tawnte them, The Husband men vtterly defye
them, The laboryng men bluntly chyde them, The wemen with a loud
exclamation<a class="afnanc" href="#fn52" id="fnanc52">52</a>
wonder at them, And all Children with clappinge
handes crye out at them. I manye times musing with my selfe at
these mischeuous misliuers, merueled when they toke their oryginall
<i>and</i> beginning; how long they haue exercised their execrable wandring
about. I thought it méete to confer with a very old man that
I was well acquaynted with, whose wyt <i>and</i> memory is meruelous for
his yeares, beinge about the age of fourescore, what he knewe when he
was yonge of these lousey leuterars. And he shewed me, that when
he was yonge he wayted vpon a man of much worshyp in Kent, who
died immediatly after the last Duke of Buckingham was beheaded:
at his buryall there was such a number of beggers, besides poore
housholders dwelling there abouts, that vnneth they mighte lye or
stande aboute the House: then was there <span class="spleaf">[leaf 3, back]</span> prepared for
them a great and a large barne, and a great fat oxe sod out in
Furmenty for them, with bread <i>and</i> drinke aboundantly to furnesh
out the premisses; and euery person had two
pence, for such was the <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
dole. When Night approched, <i>th</i>e pore housholdere repaired home
to their houses: the other wayfaring bold beggers remained alnight
in <i>th</i>e barne; and the same barne being serched with light in the
night by this old man (and then yonge), with<a class="afnanc" href="#fn53" id="fnanc53">53</a>
others, they tolde
seuen score persons of men, euery of them hauing his woma<i>n</i>, except
it were two wemen that lay alone to gether for some especyall cause.
Thus hauing their makes to make mery withall, the buriall was turned
to bousing <i>and</i> belly chere, morning to myrth, fasting to feasting,
prayer to pastyme <i>and</i> pressing of papes, and lamenting to Lechery.
So that it may apere this vncomly company hath had a long continuance,
but then nothinge geuen so much to pylferinge, pyckinge, and
spoyling; and, as far as I can learne or vnderstand by the examination
of a number of them, their languag—which they terme peddelars
Frenche or Canting—began but within these xxx. yeeres,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn54" id="fnanc54">54</a>
lytle
aboue; and that the first inuenter therof was hanged, all saue the
head; for that is the fynall end of them all, or els to dye of some
filthy and horyble diseases: but much harme is don in the meane
space by their continuance, as some x., xii., and xvi. yeares before
they be consumed, and the number of them doth dayly renew. I
hope their synne is now at the hyghest; and that as short and as
spedy a redresse wylbe for these, as hath bene of late yeres for <i>th</i>e
wretched, wily, wandering vagabonds calling and naming them selues
Egiptians, depely dissembling and long hyding <i>and</i> couering their
depe, decetfull practises,—feding the rude common people, wholy
addicted and geuen to nouelties, toyes, and new inuentions,—delyting
them with the strangenes of the attyre of their heades, and
practising paulmistrie to such as would know their fortunes: And, to
be short, all theues and hores (as I may well wryt),—as some haue
had true experience, a number can well wytnes, and a great sorte hath
well felte it. And now (thankes bée to god), throughe wholsome
lawes, and the due execution thereof, all be dispersed,
banished,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn55" id="fnanc55">55</a>
<i>and</i>
the memory of them cleane extynguished; that when they bée once
named here after, our Chyldren wyll muche meruell what kynd of
people they were: and so, I trust, shal shortly
happen of these. <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
For what thinge doth chiefely cause these rowsey rakehelles thus to
continue and dayly increase? Surely a number of wicked parsons
that kéepe typlinge Houses in all shires, where they haue succour
and reliefe; and what so euer they bring, they are sure to receaue
money for <span class="spleaf">[leaf 4]</span> the same, for they sell good penyworthes. The
byers haue <i>th</i>e greatest gayne; yea, yf they haue nether money nor
ware, they wylbe trusted; their credite is much. I haue taken a
note of a good many of them, <i>and</i> wil send their names and dwelling-places
to such Iusticers as dwelleth nere or next vnto them, that
they by their good wisdomes may displace the same, and auctoryse
such as haue honesty. I wyl not blot my boke with their names,
because they be resident. But as for this fletinge Fellowshyp, I
haue truly setforth the most part of them that be doers at this present,
with their names that they be knowene by. Also, I haue
placed in the end therof their leud language, calling the same pedlers
French or Canting. And now shal I end my prologue, makinge true
declaration (right honorable Lady) as they shal fall in order of their
vntymelye tryfelinge time, leud lyfe, and pernitious practises, trusting
that the same shall neyther trouble or abash your most tender,
tymerous, and pytifull Nature, to thinke the smal mede should growe
vnto you for such Almes so geuen. For god, our marcifull and most
louing father, well knoweth your hartes and good intent,—the geuer
neuer wanteth his reward, according to the sayinge of Saynt Augustyn:
as there is (neyther shalbe) any synne vnpunished, euen so
shall there not be eny good dede vnrewarded. But how comfortably
speaketh Christ our Sauiour vnto vs in his gospel (“geue ye, and it
shalbe geuen you againe”): behold farther, good Madam, that for a
cup of colde water, Christ hath promised a good reward. Now saynt
Austen properly declareth why Christ speaketh of colde water, because
the poorest man that is shall not excuse him selfe from that
cherytable warke, least he would, parauenture, saye that he hath
neyther wood, pot, nor pan to warme any water with. Se, farther,
what god speaketh in the mouth of his prophet, Esaye, “breake thy
bread to him that is a hongred;” he sayth not geue him a hole lofe,
for paraduenture the poore man hath it not to geue, then let him geue
a pece. This much is sayd because the poore that hath
it should not <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
<span id="idp25">
be excused: now how much more then the riche? Thus you se, good<br />
madam, for your treasure here dispersed, where nede and lacke<br />
is, it shalbe heaped vp aboundantly for you in heauen,<br />
where neither rust or moth shall corupt or destroy<br />
the same. Vnto which tryumphant place, after<br />
many good, happy, and fortunat yeres pros-<br />
perouslye here dispended, you maye for<br />
euer and euer there most ioyfully<br />
remayne. A men.</span></p>

though, good Reader, I wright in plain termes—and not so
playnly as truely—concerning the matter, meaning honestly
to all men, and wyshe them as much good as to myne owne
harte; yet, as there hathe bene, so there is nowe, and hereafter wylbe,
curyous heds to finde faultes: wherefore I thought it necessary, now
at this seconde Impression, to acquaynt <i>th</i>e with a great faulte, as
some takethe it, but none<a class="afnanc" href="#fn57" id="fnanc57">57</a>
as I meane it, callinge these Vagabonds
Cursetors in the intytelynge of my booke, as runneres or rangers
aboute the countrey, deriued of this Laten word (<i>Curro</i>): neither do
I wryght it Cooresetores, with a duble<a class="afnanc" href="#fn58" id="fnanc58">58</a>
oo; or Cowresetors, with a w,
which hath an other signification: is there no deuersite betwen a
gardein and a garden, maynteynaunce <i>and</i> maintenance, Streytes and
stretes? those that haue vnderstanding knowe there is a great dyfference:
who is so ignorant by these dayes as knoweth not the meaning
of a vagabone? and yf an ydell leuterar should be so called of eny
man, would not he thi<i>n</i>k it bothe odyous and reprochefull? wyll he
not shonne the name? ye, and where as he maye and dare, w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> bent
browes, wyll reueng that name of Ingnomy: yet this playne name
vagabone is deryued, as others be, of Laten wordes, and now vse
makes it commen to al men; but let vs loke back four .C. yeres
sithens, <i>and</i> let vs se whether this playn word vagabon was vsed or
no. I beleue not, and why? because I rede of no such name in the
old estatutes of this realme, vnles it be in the margente of the booke,
or in the Table, which in the collection and pryntinge was set in;
but these were then the co<i>m</i>men names of these leud leuterars,
Faytores, Robardesmen, Drawlatches, <i>and</i> valyant beggares. Yf I
should haue vsed suche wordes, or the same order of wryting, as this
realme vsed in Kynge Henry the thyrd or Edward <i>th</i>e fyrstes tyme,
oh, what a grose, barberous fellow <span class="spleaf">[leaf 5, back]</span> haue we here! his
wryting is both homely and darke, that wee had nede to haue an

change we see&#x202f;. well, this delycat age shall haue
his tyme on the <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>

the muses; I neuer tasted of Helycon. But accordinge to my playne
order, I haue setforth this worke, symplye and truelye, with such
vsual words and termes as is among vs wel known and frequented.
So that as <i>th</i>e prouerbe saythe, “all though truth be blamed, it shal
neuer be shamed.” well, good reader, I meane not to be tedyous vnto
the, but haue added fyue or sixe more tales, because some of them
weare donn whyle my booke was fyrste in the presse; and as I
truste I haue deserued no rebuke for my good wyll, euen so I desyre

Rufflar, because he is first in degre of this odious order: And
is so called in a statute made for the punishment of Vacabonds, In
the xxvij. yeare of Kyng Henry the eight, late of most famous memory:
Hée shall be first placed, as the worthiest of this vnruly rablement.
And he is so called when he goeth first abroad; eyther he hath serued
in the warres, or els he hath bene a seruinge man; and, weary of well
doing, shakinge of all payne, doth chuse him this ydle lyfe, and
wretchedly wanders aboute the most shyres of this realme. And with
stout audacyte, <a class="afnanc" href="#fn60" id="fnanc60">60</a>&#x202f;demaundeth where he thinketh hée maye be bolde, and
circomspecte ynough, as he sethe cause to aske charitie, rufully and
lamentably, that it would make a flyntey hart to relent, and pytie his
miserable estate, howe he hath bene maymed and broused in the warres;
<i>and</i>, parauenture, some wyll shew you some outward wounde, whiche he
gotte at some dronken fraye, eyther haltinge of some preuye wounde
festred with a fylthy firy flankard. For be well assured that the
hardist souldiers be eyther slayne or maymed, eyther and<a class="afnanc" href="#fn61" id="fnanc61">61</a>
they escape
all hassardes, and retourne home agayne, if they bée without reliefe
of their friends, they wyl surely desperatly robbe and steale, and<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnanc62">62</a>
eyther shortlye be hanged or miserably dye in pryson; for they be so
much ashamed and disdayne to beg or aske charity, that rather they
wyll as desperatlye fight for to lyue and mayntayne them selues, as
manfully and valyantly they ventred them selues in the Prynces quarell.
Now these Rufflars, the out castes of seruing men, when begginge or
crauinge fayles, then they pycke and pylfer, from other inferiour
beggeres that they méete by the waye, as Roages, Pallyardes, Mortes,
and Doxes. Yea, if they méete with a woman alone ridinge to the market,
eyther olde man or boye, that hée well knoweth wyll not resiste, such
they filche and spoyle. These rufflars, after a yeare or two at the
farthest, become vpryght men, vnlesse they be preuented by twind
hempe.</p>

I had of late yeares an old man to my
   tennant, who customably a greate tyme went twise in the wéeke
   to London, eyther&#xa0;}
wyth fruite
or with pescodes, when tyme serued therefore. And as he was comminge
homewarde on blacke heathe, at the end thereof next to shotars hyl,
he ouer tooke two rufflars, the one manerly wayting on the other, as
one had ben the maister, <i>and</i> the other the man or seruant,
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 6, back]</span>
caryinge his maisteres cloke. this olde man was verye glad that
hee might haue their company ouer the hyl, because that day he had
made a good market; for hée had seuen shyllinges in his purse, and a
nolde angell, which this poore man had thought had not bene in his
purse, for hée wylled his wyfe ouer night to take out the same angell,
and laye it vp vntyll his comminge home agayne. And he verely thought
that his wyfe had so don, whiche in dede for got to do it. Thus after
salutations had, this maister rufflar entered into co<i>m</i>munication with
this simple olde man, who, ridinge softlye beside them, commoned of
many matters. Thus fedinge this old man with pleasaunt talke, vntyll
they weare one the toppe of the hyll, where these rufflares might
well beholde the coaste about them cleare, Quiclye stepes vnto this
poore man, and taketh holde of his horse brydell, and leadeth him in
to the wode, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he had in
his purse. “Now, by my troth,” quoth this old man; “you are a merrye
gentle man. I knowe you meane not to take a waye anye thinge from me,
but rather to geue me some if I shoulde aske it of you.” By and by,
this seruant thiefe casteth the cloke that he caried on his arme about
this poore mans face, that he should not marke or vew them, with sharpe
words to delyuer quicly that he had, and to confesse truly what was
in his purse. This poore man, then all abashed, yelded, and confessed
that he had but iust seuen shyllinges in his purse; and the trouth is
he knew of no more. This old angell was falen out of a lytle purse into
the botome of a great purse. Now, this seuen shyllings in whyte money
they quickly founde, thinkinge in dede that there had bene no more; yet
farther groping and searchinge, found this old angell. And with great
admiration, this gentleman thyefe begane to blesse hym, sayinge, “good
lorde, what a worlde is this! howe maye” (quoth hée) “a man beleue
<span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
or truste in the same? se you not” (quoth he) “this old knaue tolde me
that he had but seuen shyllings, and here is more by an angell: what an
old knaue and a false knaue haue we here!” quoth this rufflar; “oure
lorde haue mercy on vs, wyll this worlde neuer be better?”—and there
with went their waye. And lefte the olde man in the wood, doinge him
no more harme. But sorowfully sighinge, this olde man, returning home,
declared his misaduenture, with all the words and circumstaunces aboue
shewed. Wherat, for the tyme was great laughing, and this poore man for
his losses among his louing neighboures well considered in the end.</p>

and Kent, as the cheyfe and best shyres of reliefe. Yea,
not with out punishment by stockes, whyppinges, and imprisonment,
in most of these places aboue sayde. Yet, not with standinge
they haue so good lykinge in their lewed, lecherous loyteringe, that
full quiclye all their punishmentes is<a class="afnanc" href="#fn64" id="fnanc64">64</a>
for gotten. And repentaunce
is neuer thought vpon vntyll they clyme thrée tres with a ladder.
These vnrewly rascales, in their roylynge, disperse them selues into
seuerall companyes, as occation serueth, sometyme more and somtyme
lesse. As, if they repayre to a poore husbandmans house, hée wyll
go a lone, or one with him, and stoutely demaund his charytie,
eyther shewing how he hath serued in the warres, and their maymed,
eyther that he sekethe seruice, and saythe that he woulde be glad to
take payne for hys lyuinge, althoughe he
meaneth nothinge lesse. <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
Yf he be offered any meate or drynke, he vtterlye refusethe scornefully,
and wyll nought but money; and yf he espye yong pyges or
pultry, he well noteth the place, and they the next night, or shortly
after, hée wyll be sure to haue some of them, whyche they brynge to
their stawlinge kens, which is their typplyng houses, as well knowen
to them, according to the olde prouerbe, “as the begger knowes his
dishe.” For you must vnderstand, euery Typplyng ale house wyll
neyther receiue them or their wares, but some certayne houses in euery
shyre, especially for that purpose, where they shalbe better welcome
to them then honester men. For by such haue they most gayne, and
shalbe conuayde eyther into some loft out of the waye, or other secret
corner not commen to any other; and thether repayre, at accustomed
tymes, their harlots, whiche they terme Mortes and Doxes,—not with
emty hands; for they be as skilfull in picking, riffling, <i>and</i> filching
as the vpright men, and nothing inferior to them in all kind of wyckednes,
as in other places hereafter they shalbe touched. At these
foresayde peltinge, peuish places and vnmannerly metinges, O! how
the pottes walke about! their talki<i>n</i>g tounges talke at large. They
bowle and bowse one to another, and for the tyme bousing belly
chere. And after there ruysting recreation, <span class="spleaf">[leaf 7, back]</span> yf there be
not rome ynough in the house, they haue cleane strawe in some
barne or backehouse nere adioyning, where they couch comly to
gether, and<a class="afnanc" href="#fn65" id="fnanc65">65</a>
it were dogge and byche; and he that is hardyste maye
haue his choyse, vnlesse for a lytle good maner; some wyll take
there owne that they haue made promyse vnto, vntyll they be out of
sight, and then, according to the old adage, “out of minde.” Yet
these vpright men stand so much vpon their reputation, as they wyl
in no case haue their wemen walke with them, but seperat them
selues for a tyme, a moneth or more. And mete at fayres, or great
markets, where they mete to pylfer and steale from staules, shoppes,
or bothes. At these fayres the vpryght men vse commonly to lye
<i>and</i> lingar in hye wayes by lanes, some prety way or distaunce from
<i>th</i>e place, by which wayes they be assured that compeny passeth
styll two and fro. And ther they<a class="afnanc" href="#fn66" id="fnanc66">66</a>
wyll demaund, with cap in hand
and comly curtesy, the deuotion and charity of
<i>th</i>e people. They <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
haue ben much lately whipped at fayrs. Yf they aske at a stout
yemans or farmars house his charity, they wyll goe strong as thre or
foure in a company. Where for feare more then good wyll, they
often haue reliefe. they syldome or neuer passe by a Iustices
house, but haue by wayes, vnlesse he dwell alone, and but weakely
manned; thether wyll they also go strong, after a slye, suttle sorte, as
with their armes bounde vp with kercher or lyste, hauinge wrapte
about the same filthy clothes, either their legges in such maner bewrapped
halting down right. Not vnprouided of good codg[e]ls,
which they cary to sustayne them, and, as they fayne, to kéepe
gogges<a class="afnanc" href="#fn67" id="fnanc67">67</a>
from them, when they come to such good gentlemens houses.
Yf any searche be made or they suspected for pylfring clothes of
hedgges, or breaking of houses, which they commonly do when the
owners bée eyther at the market, church, or other wayes occupyed
aboute their busines,—eyther robbe some sely man or woman by the
hye waye, as many tymes they do,—Then they hygh them into wodes,
great thickets, and other ruffe corners, where they lye lurkinge thre or
foure dayes to gether, and haue meate and drinke brought them by
theyre Mortes, and Doxes; and whyle they thus lye hydden in
couert, in the night they be not idle,—nether, as <i>th</i>e common saying
is, “well occupyed;” for then, as the wyly foxe, crepinge out of his
den, seketh his praye for pultery, so do these for lynnen and any
thinge els worth money, that lyeth about or near a house. As somtyme
a whole bucke of clothes caryed awaye at a tyme. When they
haue a greatter booty then they maye cary awaye quickly to their
stawling kendes, as is aboue sayd, They wyll hyde the same for a
thre dayes in some thicke couert, and <span class="spleaf">[leaf 8]</span> in the night time carye
the same, lyke good water Spanlles, to their foresayd houses. To
whom they wyll discouer where or in what places they had the same,
where the markes shalbe pycked out cleane, <i>and</i> conuayed craftely
fare of, to sell. If the man or woman of the house want money
the<i>m</i> selues. <a class="afnanc" href="#fn68" id="fnanc68">68</a>If these vpright men haue nether money nor wares, at
these houses they shalbe trusted for their vitales, and it amount to
twentye or thirty shyllings. Yea, if it fortune any of these vpright
men to be taken, either suspected, or charged
with fellony or petye <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
brybrye, don at such a tyme or such a place, he wyll saye he was in
his hostes house. And if the man or wyfe of that house be examined
by an officer, they boldelye vouche, that the[y] lodged him
suche a tyme, whereby the truth cannot appeare. And if they
chaunce to be retained into seruice, through their lamentable words,
with any welthy man, They wyll tary but a smale tyme, either robbing
his maister or som of his fellowes. And some of them vseth this
polocye, that although they trauayle into al these shyres, aboue said,
yet wyl they haue good credite, espiciallye in one shyre, where at
diuers good farmars houses they be wel knowen, where they worke a
moneth in a place or more, and wyll for that time behaue them selues
very honestly <i>and</i> paynfully; And maye at any tyme, for their good
vsage, haue worke of them; and to these at a ded lyft, or last
refuge, they maye safely repayre vnto and be welcom, When in other
places, for a knacke of knauery that they haue playd, thei dare not
tary. These vpright men wil sildom or neuer want; for what is
gotten by anye Mort, or Doxe, if it please him, hée doth comaunde
the same. And if he mete any begger, whether he be sturdye or
impotent, he wyll demaund of him, whether euer he was stalled to
the roge or no. If he saye he was, he wyll know of whom, and his
name <i>tha</i>t stalled hym. And if he be not learnedly able to shewe
him the whole circumstaunce thereof, he wyll spoyle him of his
money, either of his best garment, if it be worth any money, and
haue him to the bowsing ken, Which is to some typpling house next
adioyninge; and laieth their to gage the best thing that he hath for
twenty pence or two shyllinges: this man obeyeth for feare of beating.
Then doth this vpright man call for a gage of bowse, whiche is
a quarte pot of drinke, and powres the same vpon his peld pate, adding
these words:—“I. G. P. do stalle thée W. T. to the Roge, and that
from hence forth it shall be lawefull for the to Cant”—that is, to
aske or begge—“for thy liuing in al places.” Here you se <i>tha</i>t the
vpright man is of great auctorite. For all sortes of beggers are
obedient to his hests, and surmounteth all others in pylfring and
stealinge. ¶ I lately had standinge in my <span class="spleaf">[leaf 8, back]</span> well house,
which standeth on the backeside of my house, a great cawdron of
copper, beinge then full of water, hauinge in the same
halfe a doson <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
of pewter dyshes, well marked, and stamped w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the connizance of
my armes, whiche being well noted when they were taken out, were
set a side, the water powred out, and my caudren taken awaye, being
of such bygnes that one man, vnlesse he were of great strength, was
not able far to cary the same. Not withstandinge, the same was one
night within this two yeares conuayed more then half a myle from
my house, into a commen or heth, And ther bestowed in a great firbushe.
I then immediatly the next day sent one of my men to
London, and there gaue warning in Sothwarke, kent strete, and
Barmesey stréete, to all the Tynckars there dwelling,—That if any
such Caudron came thether to be sold, the bringar therof should be
stayed, and promised twenty shyllings for a reward. I gaue also intelligence
to the water men that kept the ferres, that no such vessel
should be ether conuayd to London or into essex, promysing the lyke
reward, to haue vnderstanding therof. This my doing was well
vnderstand in many places about, and that the feare of espyinge so
troubled <i>th</i>e conscience of the stealer, that my caudoren laye
vntouched in the thicke firbushe more then halfe a yeare after,
which, by a great chaunce, was found by hunteres for conneys; for
one chaunced to runne into the same bushe where my caudren was,
and being perceaued, one thrust his staffe into the same bushe, and
hyt my caudren a great blowe, the sound whereof dyd cause the
man to thinke and hope that there was some great treasure hidden,
wherby he thought to be the better whyle he lyued. And in farther
searching he found my caudren; so had I the same agayne vnloked
for.</p>

to be short, they sat <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
out al the company, for eche man departed home aboute their
busines. When they had well refreshed them selues, then these
rowsy roges requested the good man of the house wyth his wyfe to
sit downe and drinke with them, of whome they inquired what priest
the same was, and where he dwelt: then they fayninge that they
had an vncle a priest, and that he should dwel in these partes, which
by all presumptions it should be he, and that they came of purpose
to speake with hym, but because they had not sene hym sithens they
were sixe yeares olde, they durst not be bold to take acquayntance
of him vntyl they were farther instructed of the truth, and began to
inquier of his name, and how longe he had dwelt there, and how
farre his house was of from <i>th</i>e place they were in: the good wyfe of
the house, thynkinge them honest men without disceit, because they
so farre enquyred of their kinseman, was but of a good zelous naturall
intent, shewed them cherefully that hee <span class="spleaf">[leaf 10]</span> was an honest
man <i>and</i> welbeloued in the parish, and of good welth, <i>and</i> had ben
there resident xv. years at the least; “but,” saith she, “are you both
brothers?” “yea, surely,” said they, “we haue bene both in one
belly, <i>and</i> were twinnes.” “Mercy, god!” q<i>uoth</i> this folish woman;
“it may wel be, for ye be not much vnlike,”—and wente vnto her
hall windowe, callinge these yong men vnto her, and loking out
therat,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn70" id="fnanc70">70</a>
pointed with her fingar <i>and</i> shewed them the house standing
alone, no house nere the same by almoste a quarter of a myle;
“that,” sayd<a class="afnanc" href="#fn71" id="fnanc71">71</a>
she, “is your vncles house.” “Nay,” saith one of
them, “he is not onely my vncle, but also my godfather.” “It may
well be,” q<i>uoth</i> she, “nature wyll bind him to be the better vnto
you.” “Well,” q<i>uoth</i> they, “we be weary, and meane not to trouble
our vncle to-night; but to-morowe, god willinge, we wyll sée him
and do our duty: but, I pray you, doth our vncle occupy husbandry?
what company hath he in his house.” “Alas!” saith she, “but one
old woman <i>and</i> a boy, he hath no occupying at al: tushe,” q<i>uoth</i>
this good wyfe, “you be mad men; go to him this night, for hée
hath better lodging for you then I haue, <i>and</i> yet I speake folishly
against my<a class="afnanc" href="#fn72" id="fnanc72">72</a>
own profit, for by your taring<a class="afnanc" href="#fn73" id="fnanc73">73</a>
here I should gaine <i>th</i>e
more by you.” “Now, by my troth,” q<i>uoth</i> one of
them, “we thanke <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
you, good hostes, for your holsome councell, and we meane to do as
you wyll vs: we wyl pause a whyle, and by that tyme it wylbe almost
night; <i>and</i> I praye you geue vs a reckeninge,”—so, manerly paying
for that they toke, bad their hoste and hostes farewell with takinge
leaue of the cup, marched merelye out of the dores towardes this
parsones house, vewed the same well rounde about, and passed by
two bowshotes of into a younge wodde, where they laye consultinge
what they shoulde do vntyll midnight. Quoth one of them, of
sharper wyt and subtyller then the other, to hys fellowe, “thou seest
that this house is stone walled about, and that we cannot well breake
in, in any parte thereof; thou seest also that the windowes be thicke
of mullions, that ther is no kreping in betwene: wherefore we must
of necessytie vse some policye when strength wil not serue. I haue
a horse locke here about me,” saith he; “and this I hope shall serue
oure turne.” So when it was aboute xii. of the clocke, they came to
the house and lurked nere vnto his chamber wyndowe: the dog of the
house barked a good, that with they<a class="afnanc" href="#fn74" id="fnanc74">74</a>
noise, this priest waketh out
of his sléepe, and began to cough and hem: then one of these roges
stepes forth nerer the window <i>and</i> maketh a ruful <i>and</i> pityful noise,
requiring for Christ sake<a class="afnanc" href="#fn75" id="fnanc75">75</a>
some reliefe, that was both hongry and
thirstye, and was like to ly with out the dores all nighte and starue
for colde, vnles he were releued by him with some small pece of
money. “Where dwellest thou?” quoth this parson. “Alas! sir,”
saithe this roge, “I haue smal <span class="spleaf">[leaf 10, back]</span> dwelling, and haue com out
of my way; and I should now,” saith he, “go to any towne nowe at
this time of night, they woulde set me in the stockes and punishe
me.” “Well,” quoth this pitifull parson, “away from my house,
either lye in some of my out houses vntyll the morning, and holde,
here is a couple of pence for thée.” “A god rewarde you,” quoth
this roge; “and in heauen may you finde it.” The parson openeth
his wyndowe, and thrusteth out his arme to geue his almes to this
Roge that came whining to receiue it, and quickly taketh holde of his
hand, and calleth his fellowe to him, whiche was redye at hande with
the horse locke, and clappeth the same about the wrest of his arme,
that the mullions standing so close together for
strength, that for his <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
life he could not plucke in his arme againe, and made him beleue,
vnles he would at the least geue them .iii. li., they woulde smite of
his arme from the body. So that this poore parson, in feare to lose
his hand, called vp his olde woman that lay in the loft ouer him,
and wylled her to take out all the money he had, which was iiij.
markes, which he saide was all the money in his house, for he had
lent vi. li. to one of his neighbours not iiij daies before. “Wel,”
q<i>uoth</i> they, “master parson, if you haue no more, vpon this condicion
we wil take of the locke, that you will drinke .xij. pence for
our sakes to-morow at the alehouse wher we found you, and thank
the good wife for the good chere she made vs.” He promised faithfully
that he would so do; so they toke of the locke, and went their
way so farre ere it was daye, that the parson coulde neuer haue any
vnderstanding more of them. Now this parson, sorowfully slumbering
that night betwene feare and hope, thought it was but folly to
make two sorrowes of one; he vsed contentacion for his remedy, not
forgetting in the morning to performe his promise, but went betims
to his neighbour that kept tiplinge, and asked angerly where the
same two men were that dranke with her yester daye. “Which two
men?” q<i>uoth</i> this good wife. “The straungers that came in when I
was at your house wyth my neighbores yesterday.” “What! your
neuewes?” q<i>uoth</i> she. “My neuewes?” q<i>uoth</i> this parson; “I
trowe thou art mad.” “Nay, by god!” q<i>uoth</i> this good<a class="afnanc" href="#fn76" id="fnanc76">76</a>
wife, “as
sober as you; for they tolde me faithfully that you were their vncle:
but, in fayth, are you not so in dede? for, by my trouth, they are
strau[n]gers to me. I neuer saw them before.” “O, out vpon
them!” q<i>uoth</i> the parson; “they be false theues, and this night
thei compelled me to geue them al the money in my house.”
“Benedicite!” q<i>uoth</i> this good wife, “<i>and</i> haue they so in dede? as
I shall aunswere before god, one of them told me besides that you
were godfather to him, and that he trusted to haue your blessinge
before he departed.” “What! did he?” quoth this parson; “a
halter blesse him for <span class="spleaf">[leaf 11]</span> me!” “Me thinketh, by the masse, by
your countenance you loked so wildly when you came in,” quoth
this good wife, “that somthing was amis.” “I
vse not to gest,” <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
quoth this parson, “when I speake so earnestly.” “Why, all your
sorrowes goe with it,” quoth this good wife, “and sitte downe here,
and I will fil a freshe pot of ale shall make you mery agayne.”
“Yea,” saith this parson, “fill in, <i>and</i> geue me some meat; for they
made me sweare and promise them faithfully that I shoulde drinke
xii. pence with you this day.” “What! dyd they?” quoth she;
“now, by the mary masse, they be mery knaues. I warraunt you they
meane to bye no land with your money; but how could they come
into you in the night, your dores being shut fast? your house is
very stronge.” Then this prason<a class="afnanc" href="#fn77" id="fnanc77">77</a>
shewed her all the hole circumstance,
how he gaue them his almes oute at the wyndowe, they<a class="afnanc" href="#fn78" id="fnanc78">78</a>
made such lamentable crye that it pytied him at the hart; for he
sawe but one when he put oute his hand at the windowe. “Be
ruled by me,” quoth this good wyfe. “Wherin?” quoth this parson.
“By my troth, neuer speake more of it: when they shal vnderstand
of it in the parish, they wyll but laugh you to skorne.”

Wilde Roge is he that is borne a Roge: he is a more subtil
and more geuen by nature to all kinde of knauery then the
other, as beastely begotten in barne or bushes, and from his
infancye traded vp in trechery; yea, and before ripenes of yeares
doth permyt, wallowinge in lewde lechery, but that is counted
amongest them no sin. For this is their custome, that when they
mete in barne at night, euery one getteth a make<a class="afnanc" href="#fn80" id="fnanc80">80</a>
to lye wythall,
<i>and</i> their chaunce to be twentye in a companye, as their is sometyme
more and sometyme lesse: for to one man that goeth abroad, there
are at the least two women, which neuer make it straunge when they
be called, although she neuer knewe him before. Then when the
day doth appeare, he rouses him vp, and shakes his eares, and awaye
wanderinge where he may gette oughte to the hurte of others. Yet
before he skyppeth oute of hys couche and departeth from his

where to mete shortlye <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>

<p>¶ Not long sithens, a wild roge chau<i>n</i>ced to mete a pore neighbour
of mine, who for honesty <i>and</i> good natur surmou<i>n</i>teth many.
This poore man, riding homeward from London, where he had made
his market, this <span class="spleaf">[leaf 11, back]</span> roge demaunded a peny for gods sake,
to kepe him a true man. This simple man, beholding him wel, and
sawe he was of taule personage with a good quarter staffe in his
hand, it much pitied him, as he sayd, to se him want; for he was
well able to serue his prince in the wars. Thus, being moued with
pytie, and<a class="afnanc" href="#fn81" id="fnanc81">81</a>
loked in his pursse to finde out a penye; and in loking
for the same, he plucked oute viii. shyllinges in whyte money, and
raked therin to finde a single peny; and at the last findinge one,
doth offer the same to this wylde roge: but he, seinge so much mony
in this simple mans hand, being striken to the hart with a couetous
desire, bid him forth wyth delyuer al that he had, or els he woulde
with his staffe beat out his braynes. For it was not a penye would
now quench his thirst, <span class="nowrap"><a class="afnanc" href="#fn82" id="fnanc82">82</a>‡seing so much as he dyd‡:</span> thus, swallowinge
his spittell gredely downe, spoyled this poore man of al <i>th</i>e money
that he had, and lept ouer the hedge into a thicke wode, and went
his waye as merely as this good simple man came home sorowfully.
I once rebuking a wyld roge because he went idelly about, he
shewed me that he was a begger by enheritance—his Grandfather
was a begger, his father was one, and he must nedes be one by good
reason.</p>

Prigger of Prauncers be horse stealers; for to prigge signifieth
in their language to steale, <i>and</i> a Prauncer is a horse: so
beinge put together, the matter is<a class="afnanc" href="#fn83" id="fnanc83">83</a>
playne. These go commonly
in Ierkins of leatherr, or of white frese, <i>and</i> carry litle wands
in their hands, and will walke through grounds and pastures, to
search and se horses meete for their purpose. And if thei chau<i>n</i>ce

there, they fayne strayghte that they haue loste
their waye, and <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
desyre to be enstructed the beste waye to such a place. These will
also repayre to gentlemens houses and aske their charitye, and wyll
offer their seruice. And if you aske them what they can do, they
wyll saye that they can kepe two or thre Geldinges, and waite vppon
a Gentleman. These haue also their women, that walkinge from
them in other places, marke where and what they sée abroade, and
sheweth these Priggars therof when they meete, which is with in a
wéeke or two. And loke, where they steale any thinge, they conuay
<i>th</i>e same at the least thre score miles of or more.</p>

<p>¶ There was a Gentleman, a verye friende of myne, rydyng from
London homewarde into Kente, hauinge with in thrée myles of his
house busynesse, alyghted of his horse, and his man also, in a pretye
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 12]</span> vyllage, where diueres houses were, and looked aboute hym
where he myghte haue a conuenient person to walke his horse, because
hee would speake w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> a Farmer that dwelt on the backe side
of the sayde village, lytle aboue a quarter of a myle from the place
where he lighted, and had his man to waight vpon him, as it was
mete for his callinge: espying a Pryggar there standing, thinking the
same to dwell there, charging this prity prigginge person to walke
his horse well, and that they might not stande styll for takyng of
colde, and at his returne (which he saide should not be longe) he
would geue hym a peny to drinke, and so wente aboute his busines.
This peltynge Priggar, proude of his praye, walkethe his horse<a class="afnanc" href="#fn84" id="fnanc84">84</a>
vp
and downe tyll he sawe the Gentleman out of sighte, and leapes him
into the saddell, and awaye he goeth a mayne. This Gentleman returninge,
and findinge not his horses, sent his man to the one end of
the vyllage, and he went himselfe vnto the other ende, and enquired
as he went for his horses that were walked, and began some what to
suspecte, because neither he nor his man could se nor find him.
Then this Gentleman deligentlye enquired of thre or foure towne
dwellers there whether any such person, declaring his stature,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn85" id="fnanc85">85</a>
age,
apparell, with so many linaments of his body as he could call to
remembraunce. And, “vna voce,” all sayde that no such man dwelt
in their streate, neither in the parish, that they knewe of; but some
did wel remember that such a one they saw
there lyrkinge and <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
huggeringe two houres before the Gentleman came thether, and a
straunger to them. “I had thoughte,” quoth this Gentleman, “he
had here dwelled,”—and marched home manerly in his botes: farre
from the place he dwelt not. I suppose at his comming home he
sente suche wayes as he suspected or thought méete to searche for
this Prigger, but hetherto he neuer harde any tydinges agayne of his

which house I heard a great noyse, and, drawing nere, stode close
vnder the wall, and this was at one of the
clocke after midnight.” <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
Where he harde swearinge, pratinge, and wagers laying, and the pot
apase walkinge, and xl. pence gaged vpon a matche of wrastling,
pitching of the barre, and casting of the sledge. And out they goe,
in a fustian fume, into the backe syde, where was a great Axiltrye,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn92" id="fnanc92">92</a>
and there fell to pitching of the barre, being thre to thre. The
Moone dyd shine bright, the Counstable with his neighboure myght
see and beholde all that was done. And howe the wyfe of the
house was rostinge of a Pyg, whyle her gestes were in their matche.
At the laste they coulde not agree vpon a caste, and fell at wordes,
and from wordes to blowes. The Counstable with his<a class="afnanc" href="#fn93" id="fnanc93">93</a>
fellowe
runnes vnto them, to parte them, and in the partinge lyckes a drye
blowe or two. Then the noyse increased; the Counstable woulde
haue had them to<a class="afnanc" href="#fn94" id="fnanc94">94</a>
the stockes. The wyfe of the house runnes out
with her goodman to intreat the Counstable for her gestes, and
leaues the Pyg at the fyre alone. In commeth two or thrée of the
next neighboures, beinge waked wyth this noise, and into the house
they come, and fynde none therein, but the Pygge well rosted, and
carieth the same awaye wyth them, spyte and all, with suche breade
and drinke also as stoode vpon the table. When the goodman and
the goodwyfe of the house hadde intreated and pacified the Counstable,
shewinge vnto him that they were Proctors and Factores all
of Spyttell houses, and that they taryed there but to breake theyr
fast, and woulde ryde awaye immediatelye after, for they had farre to
goe, and therefore mente to ryde so earlye. And comminge into their
house agayne, fyndinge the Pygge wyth bread and drincke all gonne,
made a greate exclamation, for they knewe not who had the same.</p>

<p>¶ The Counstable returning and hearinge the lamentable wordes
of the good wyfe, howe she had lost both meate and drinke, and
sawe it was so in deede, hée laughed in his sleue, and commaunded
her to dresse no more at vnlawfull houres for any gestes. For hée
thought it better bestowed vppon those
smell feastes his poore <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
neighboures then vppon suche sturdye Lubbares. The nexte mornynge
betymes the <span class="spleaf">[leaf 13, back]</span> spitte and pottes were sette at the Spittle
house doore for the owner. Thus were these Factours begyled
of theyr breakefast, and one of them hadde well beaten an other;
“And, by my trouth,” (quoth thys Counstable) “I was gladde when
I was well ryd of them.” “Why,” quoth I, “coulde the[y] caste
the barre and sledge well?” “I wyll tell you, syr,” (quoth hée)
“you knowe there hath bene manye games this Sommer. I thinke
verely, that if some of these Lubbars had bene there, and practysed
amongest others, I beleue they woulde haue carryed awaye the beste
games. For they were so stronge and sturdye, that I was not able to
stande in their handes.” “Well” (quoth I) “at these games you
speake of, both legges and armes bée tryed.” “Yea,” quoth this
offycer, “they bée wycked men. I haue séene some of them sithens
wyth cloutes bounde aboute theyr legges, and haltynge wyth their
staffe in their handes. Wherefore some of theym, by GOD, bée
nought all.”</p>

names and seales of some men of worshyp in Shropshyre, and in
other Shieres farre of, that I haue well knowne, and haue taken the

immediatly sell the same, for weare it they wyll
not, because they would bée the more pitied, and weare fylthy clothes

that they wyll fome as it were a Boore, <i>and</i> maruelously for a tyme
torment them selues; and thus deceiue they the common people, and
gayne much. These haue commonly their harlots as the other.</p>

<p>Apon Alhollenday in the morning last Anno domini. 1566, or
my<a class="afnanc" href="#fn100" id="fnanc100">100</a>
booke was halfe printed, I meane the first impression, there came
earely in the morninge a Counterfet Cranke vnder my lodgynge at the
whyte Fryares, wythin the cloyster, in a lyttle yard or coorte, where
aboutes laye two or thre great Ladyes, beyng without the lyberties of
London, where by he hoped for the greatter gayne; this Cranke there
lamentably lamentinge and pitefully crying to be releued, declared to
dyuers their hys paynfull and miserable dysease. I being rysen
and not halfe ready, harde his dolfull wordes and rufull mornings,
hering him name the falling sicknes, thought assuredlye to my selfe
that hée was a depe desemblar; so, comminge out at a sodayne, and
beholdinge his vgly and yrksome attyre, hys lothsome and horyble
countinance, it made me in a meruelous parplexite what to thinke of
hym, whether it were fayned or trouth,—for after this manner went
he: he was naked from the wast vpward, sauyng he had a old
Ierken<a class="afnanc" href="#fn101" id="fnanc101">101</a>
of leather patched, and that was lose<a class="afnanc" href="#fn102" id="fnanc102">102</a>
about hym, that all
his bodye laye out bare; a filthy foule cloth
he ware on his head, <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
being cut for the purpose, hauing a narowe place to put out his face,
with a bauer made to trusse vp his beard, and a stryng that tyed the
same downe close aboute his necke; with an olde felt hat which he
styll caried in his hande to receaue the charytye and deuotion of the
people, for that woulde he hold out from hym; hauyng hys face,
from the eyes downe ward, all smerd with freshe bloud, <span class="spleaf">[leaf 15, back]</span>
as thoughe he had new falen, and byn tormented wyth his paynefull
panges,—his Ierken beinge all be rayde with durte and myre, and
hys hatte and hosen also, as thoughe hée hadde wallowed in the
myre: sewerly the sighte was monstrous and terreble. I called hym
vnto me, and demaunded of hym what he ayled. “A, good maister,”
quoth he, “I haue the greuous and paynefull dyseas called the
falynge syckenes.” “Why,” quoth I, “howe commeth thy Ierken,
hose, and hat so be rayd with durte and myre, and thy skyn also?”
“A, good master, I fell downe on the backesyde here in the fowle
lane harde by the watersyde; and there I laye all most all night,
and haue bled all most all the bloude owte in my bodye.” It raynde
that morninge very fast; and whyle I was thus talkinge with hym, a
honest poore woman that dwelt thereby brought hym a fayre lynnen
cloth, and byd hym wype his face therewyth; and there beinge a tobbe
standing full of rayne water, offered to geue hym some in a dishe
that he might make hym selfe cleane: hée refuseth<a class="afnanc" href="#fn103" id="fnanc103">103</a>
the same.
“Why dost thou so?” quoth I. “A, syr,” sayth he, “yf I shoulde
washe my selfe, I shoulde fall to bléedinge a freshe againe, and then
I should not stop my selfe:” these wordes made me the more to
suspecte hym.</p>

<p>Then I asked of hym where he was borne, what is name was,
how longe he had this dysease, and what tyme he had ben here
about London, and in what place. “Syr,” saythe he, “I was borne
at Leycestar, my name is Nycholas Genings,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn104" id="fnanc104">104</a>
and I haue had this
falling sycknes viij. yeares, and I can get no remedy for the same;
for I haue it by kinde, my father had it and my friendes before me;
and I haue byne these two yeares here about London, and a yeare
and a halfe in bethelem.” “Why, wast thou out of thy wyttes?”
quoth I. “Ye, syr, that I was.”</p>

<p>“What is the Kepars name of the house?” “Hys name is,”
quoth hée, “Iohn Smith.” “Then,” quoth I, “hée must vnderstande
of thy dysease; yf thou hadest the same for the tyme thou
wast there, he knoweth it well.” “Ye, not onely he, but all the
house bée syde,” quoth this Cranke; “for I came thens but within
this fortnight.” I had stande so longe reasoning the matter wyth
him that I was a cold, and went into my chamber and made me
ready, and commaunded my seruant to repayre to bethelem, and
bringe me true worde from the keper there whether anye suche man
hath byn with him as a prisoner hauinge the dysease aforesayd, and
gaue hym a note of his name and the kepars also: my seruant,
retorninge to my lodginge, dyd assure me that neither was there
euer anye such man there, nether yet anye keper of any suche
name; but hée that was there keper, he sent me hys name in writing,
afferming that hee letteth no man depart from hym vnlesse he be
fet a waye by <span class="spleaf">[leaf 16]</span> hys fréendes, and that none that came from
hym beggeth aboute the Citye. Then I sent for the Printar of this
booke, and shewed hym of this dyssembling Cranke, and how I had
sent to Bethelem to vnderstand the trouth<a class="afnanc" href="#fn105" id="fnanc105">105</a>, and what aunsweare I
receaued againe, requiringe hym that I might haue some seruant
of his to watche him faithfully that daye, that I might vnderstand
trustely to what place he woulde repaire at night vnto, and
thether I promised to goe my selfe to sée their order, and that I
woulde haue hym to associate me thether: hée gladly graunted to
my request, and sent two boyes, that both diligently and vygelantly
accomplisht the charge geuen them, and found the same Cranke
aboute the Temple, where about the most parte of the daye hée
begged, vnlesse it weare about xii. of the clocke he wente on the
backesyde of Clementes Ine without Temple barre: there is a lane
that goeth into the Feldes; there hee renewed his face againe wyth
freshe bloud, which he caried about hym in a bladder, and dawbed
on freshe dyrte vpon his Ierken, hat, and hoson.</p>

<p>¶ And so came backe agayne vnto the Temple, and sometyme to
the Watersyde, and begged of all that passed bye: the boyes behelde
howe some gaue grotes, some syxe pens,
some gaue more; <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
for hée looked so ougleie and yrksomlye, that euerye one pytied his
miserable case that beehelde hym. To bee shorte, there he passed all
the daye tyll night approched; and when it began to bée some what
dark, he went to the water syde and toke a Skoller,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn106" id="fnanc106">106</a>
and was sette
ouer the Water into Saincte Georges feldes, contrarye to my expectatian;
for I had thought he woulde haue gonne into Holborne or to
Saynt Gylles in the felde; but these boyes, with Argues and Lynces
eyes, set sewre watche vppon him, and the one tooke a bote and followed
him, and the other went backe to tell his maister.</p>

<p>The boye that so folowed hym by Water, had no money to pay
for his Bote hyre, but layde his Penner and his Ynkhorne to gage
for a penny; and by that tyme the boye was sette ouer, his Maister,
wyth all celeryte, hadde taken a Bote and followed hym apase: now
hadde they styll a syght of the Cranke, wych crossed ouer the
felddes towardes Newyngton, and thether he went, and by that tyme
they came thether it was very darke: the Prynter hadde there no
acquaintance, nether any kynde of weapon about hym, nether knewe
he<a class="afnanc" href="#fn107" id="fnanc107">107</a>
how farre the Cranke woulde goe, becawse hee then suspected
that they dogged hym of purposse; he there stayed hym, and called
for the Counstable, whyche came forthe dylygentelye to inquyre what
the matter was: thys zelous Pryntar charged thys offycer <span class="spleaf">[leaf 16, back]</span>
wyth hym as a malefactor and a dessemblinge vagabonde—the

him into your house; for this is lyke to be a cold nyght, and he is

night, for he is well hable to paye for the same. I knowe well his
gaynes hath byn great to day, and your house is a sufficient pryson for

there vnto: they had him in, and caused him to washe him selfe:
that donne, they demaunded what money he had about hym. Sayth
this Cranke, “So God helpe me, I haue but xii. pence,” and plucked
oute the same of a lytle pursse. “Why, haue you no more?”
quoth they. “No,” sayth this Cranke, “as God shall saue my
soule at the day of iudgement.” “We must se
more,” quoth they,<span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>

false knaue, here is my boye that dyd watche thée all this daye, and
sawe when such men gaue the péeses of sixe pens, grotes, and other
money; and yet thou hast shewed vs none but small money.”
When thys Cranke hard this, and the boye vowinge it to his face,
he relented, and plucked out another pursse, where in was eyght
shyllings and od money; so had they in the hole <i>tha</i>t he had

The 1573 edition continues thus:—“wherof this crafty Cranke had part
him selfe, for he had both house and wife in the same parishe, as after you
shall heare. But this lewde lewterar could not laye his bones to labour, hauing
got once the tast of this lewd lasy lyfe, for al this fayr admonition, but deuised
other suttel sleights to maintaine his ydell liuing, and so craftely clothed
him selfe in mariners apparel, and associated him self with an other of his
companions: they hauing both mariners apparel, went abroad to aske charity
of <i>th</i>e people, fayning they hadde loste their shippe with all their goods by
casualty on the seas, wherewith they gayned much. This crafty Cranke,
fearinge to be mistrusted, fell to another kinde of begging, as bad or worse, and
apparelled himselfe very well with a fayre black fréese cote, a new payre of
whyte hose, a fyne felt hat on his head, a shert of flaunders worke esteemed to
be worth xvi. shillings; and vpon newe yeares day came againe into the whyt
Fryers to beg: the printer, hauing occasion to go that ways, not thinking of
this Cranke, by chaunce met with him, who asked his charitie for Gods sake.
The printer, vewing him well, did mistrust him to be the counterfet Cranke
which deceuied him vpon Alhollen daye at night, demaunded of whence he was
and what was his name, ‘Forsoth,’ saith he, ‘my name is Nicolas Genings,
and I came from Lecester to séeke worke, and I am a hat-maker by my occupation,
and all my money is spent, and if I coulde get money to paye for my
lodging this night, I would seke work to morowe amongst the hatters.’ The
printer perceiuing his depe dissimulation, putting his hand into his purse, seeming
to giue him some money, and with fayre allusions brought him into the
stréete, where he charged the constable with him, affirminge him to be the
counterfet Cranke that ranne away vpon Alholon daye last. The constable
being very loth to medle with him, but the printer knowing him and his depe
disceit, desyred he mought be brought before the debutie of the ward, which
straight was accomplished, which whe<i>n</i> he came before the debuty, he demaunded
of him of whence he was and what was his name; he answered as
before he did vnto <i>th</i>e printer: the debutie asked the printer what he woulde
laye vnto hys charge; he answered and aleged him to be a vagabond and depe
deceyuer of the people, and the counterfet Crank that ran away vpon Alhallon
day last from the constable of Newington and him, and requested him
earnestly to send him to ward: the debuty thinking him to be deceiued, but
neuerthelesse laid his co<i>m</i>maundement vpon him, so that the printer should
beare his charges if he could not iustifie it; he agréed thereunto. And so he
and the constable went to cary him to the Counter; and as they were going
vnder Ludgate, this crafty Cranke toke his héeles and ran down the hill as fast
as he could dryve, the constable and the printer after him as fast as they
coulde; but the printer of <i>th</i>e twayn being lighter of fote, ouertoke him at
fleete bridge, and with strong hand caried him to the counter, and safely deliuered
him. In <i>th</i>e morow <i>th</i>e printer sent his boy that stripped him vpon Alhalon
day at night to view him, because he would be sure, which boy knew him
very well: this Crank confessed unto the debuty, <i>tha</i>t he had hosted the night
before in Kent stréet in Southwarke, at the sign of the Cock, which thing to be
true, the printer sente to know, and found him a lyer; but further inquiring,
at length found out his habitation, dwelling in maister Hilles rentes, hauinge
a pretye house, well stuffed, with a fayre ioyne table, and a fayre cubbard
garnished with peuter, hauing an old auncient woman to his wyfe. The printer
being sure therof, repaired vnto the Counter, and rebuked him for his beastly
behaviour, and told him of his false fayning, willed him to confesse it, and
aske forgivenes: he perceyued him to know his depe dissimulation, relented,
and confessed all his disceit; and so remayning in the counter thrée dayes,
was removed to Brydwel, where he was strypt starke naked, and his ougly
attyre put vpo<i>n</i> him before the maisters thereof, who wondered greatly at his
dissimulation: for which offence he stode vpon the pillery in Cheapsyde, both
in his ougly and handsome attyre. And after that went in the myll whyle his
ougly picture was a drawing; and then was whypped at a cartes tayle through
London, and his displayd banner caried before him vnto his own dore, and so
backe to Brydewell again, and there remayned for a tyme, and at length let
at libertie, on that condicio<i>n</i> he would proue an honest man, and labour truly
to get his liuing. And his picture remayneth in Bridewell for a monyment.”—See,

<h3 title="A DOMMERAR">¶ <span class="smmaj">A DOMMERAR.</span> Cap. 12.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">
<span class="spdropcap">
<img class="iglyph3" src="images/p035-t-3.png"
 width="57" height="93" alt="T" /></span>Hese
Dommerars are leud and most subtyll people: the moste
part of these are Walch men, and wyll neuer speake, vnlesse
they haue extreame punishment, but wyll gape, and with a
maruelous force wyll hold downe their toungs doubled, groning for
your charyty, and holding vp their handes full pitiously, so that with
their déepe dissimulation they get very much. There are of these
many, <i>and</i> but one that I vnderstand of hath lost his toung in dede.
Hauing on a time occasion to ride to Dartforde, to speake with a
priest there, who maketh all kinde of conserues very well, and vseth
stilling of waters; And repayringe to his house, I founde a Dommerar
at his doore, and the priest him selfe perusinge his<a class="afnanc" href="#fn122" id="fnanc122">122</a>
lycence,
vnder the seales and hands of certayne worshypfull men, had<a class="afnanc" href="#fn123" id="fnanc123">123</a>
thought
the same to be good and effectuall. I taking the
same writing, and <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
reading it ouer, and noting the seales, founde one of the seales like
vnto a seale that I had aboute me, which seale I bought besides
Charing crosse, that I was out of doubte it was none of those Gentlemens
seales that had sub[s]cribed. And hauing vnderstanding
before of their peuish practises, made me to conceaue that all was
forged and nought. I made the more hast home; for well I wyst
that he would and must of force passe through the parysh where I
dwelt; for there was no other waye for hym. And comminge homewarde,
I found them in the towne, accordinge to my expectation,
where they were staid; for there was a Pallyarde associate with the
Dommerar and partaker of his gaynes, whyche Pallyarde I sawe not
at Dartford. The stayers of them was a gentleman called<a class="afnanc" href="#fn124" id="fnanc124">124</a>
<i>Chayne</i>,
and a seruant of my Lord Kéepers, cald <i>Wostestowe</i>, which was
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 17, back]</span> the chiefe causer of the staying of them, being a Surgien,
<i>and</i> cunning in his science, had séene the lyke practises, and, as he
sayde, hadde caused one to speake afore that was dome<a class="afnanc" href="#fn125" id="fnanc125">125</a>. It was my
chaunce to come at the begynning of the matter. “Syr,” (quoth
this Surgien) “I am bold here to vtter some part of my cunning.
I trust” (quoth he) “you shall se a myracle wrought anon. For I
once” (quoth he) “made a dumme man to speake.” Quoth I, “you
are wel met, and somwhat you haue preuented me; for I had
thought to haue done no lesse or they hadde passed this towne.
For I well knowe their writing is fayned, and they depe dissemblers.”
The Surgien made hym gape, <i>and</i> we could sée but halfe
a toung. I required the Surgien to put hys fynger in his mouth,
<i>and</i> to pull out his toung, and so he dyd, not withstanding he held
strongly a prety whyle; at the length he pluckt out the same, to the
great admiration of many that stode by. Yet when we sawe his
tounge, hée would neither speake nor yet could heare. Quoth I to
the Surgien, “knit two of his fyngers to gether, and thrust a stycke
betwene them, and rubbe the same vp and downe a lytle whyle, and
for my lyfe hée speaketh by and by.” “Sir,” quoth this Surgien,
“I praye you let me practise and<a class="afnanc" href="#fn126" id="fnanc126">126</a>
other waye.” I was well contented
to sée the same. He had him into a house, and tyed a halter aboute
the wrestes of his handes, and hoysed him vp
ouer a beame, and <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
there dyd let him hang a good while: at <i>th</i>e length, for very paine
he required for Gods sake to let him down. So he that was both
deafe and dume coulde in short tyme both heare and speake. Then
I tooke that money I could find in his pursse, and distributed the
same to the poore people dwelling there, whiche was xv. pence halfepeny,
being all that we coulde finde. That done, and this merry
myracle madly made, I sent them with my seruaunt to the next
Iusticer, where they preached on the Pyllery for want of a Pulpet,
and were well whypped, and none dyd bewayle them.</p>

<p>¶ A Demaunder for glymmar came vnto a good towne in Kente,
to aske the charitie of the people, hauinge a fayned lycens aboute
her that declared her misfortune by fyre, donne in Somerset shyre,
walkinge with a wallet on her shoulders, where in shée put the deuotion
of suche as hadde no money to geue her; that is to saye,
Malte, woll, baken, bread, and cheese; and alwayes, as the same was
full, so was it redye money to her, when she emptyed the same,
where so euer shee trauelede: thys harlot was, as they terme it,
snowte fayre, and had an vpright man or two alwayes attendinge on
her watche (whyche is on her parson), and yet so circumspecte, that
they woulde neuer bee séene in her company in any good towne,
vnlesse it were in smale vyllages where typling houses weare, eyther
trauelinge to gether by the hygh wayes; but <i>th</i>e troth is, by report,
she would wekely be worth vi. or seuen shyllinges with her begging
and bycherye. This glimmering Morte, repayringe to an Ine in <i>th</i>e
sayde towne where dwelt a wydow of fyftie wynter olde of good
welth; but she had an vnthryftye sonne, whom she vsed as a
chamberlaine to attend gestes when they repared to her house: this
amerous man, be holdinge with ardante eyes thys<a class="afnanc" href="#fn131" id="fnanc131">131</a>
glymmeringe
glauncer, was presentlye pyteouslye persed to the hart, and lewdlye
longed to bée clothed vnder her lyuerye; and bestowinge <span class="spleaf">[leaf 19]</span> a
<span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
fewe fonde wordes with her, vnderstode strayte that she woulde be
easlye perswaded to lykinge lechery, and as a man mased, mused
howe to attayne to his purpose, for<a class="afnanc" href="#fn132" id="fnanc132">132</a>
he hadde no money. Yet consideringe
wyth hym selfe that wares woulde bée welcome where
money wanted, hée went with a wannion to his mothers chamber,
and there sekinge aboute for odde endes, at length founde a lytle
whystell of syluer that his mother dyd vse customablye to weare on,
and had forgot the same for haste that morninge, and offeres the
same closely to this manerly marian, that yf she would mete hym on
the backesyde of the towne and curteously kys him with out constraynt,
she shoulde bée mystres thereof, and it weare much better.
“Well,” sayth she, “you are a wanton;” and beholdinge the
whystell, was farther in loue there with then rauysht wyth his
person, and agred to mete him presently, and to accomplyshe his
fonde fancy:—to be short, and not tedyous, a quarter of a myle from
the towne, he merely toke measure of her vnder a bawdye bushe; so
she gaue hym that she had not, and he receiued that he coulde not;
and taking leue of eche other with a curteous kysse, she plesantly
passed forth one her iornaye, <i>and</i> this vntoward lycorous chamberlayne
repayred home warde. But or these two tortylles tooke there
leue, the good wyfe myssed her whystell, and sent one of her
maydenes in to her chamber for the same, and being long sawght
for, none coulde be founde; her mystres hering that, diligent search
was made for the same; and that it was taken awaye, began to suspecte
her vnblessed babe, and demaunded of her maydens whether
none of them sawe her sonne in her chamber that morning, and one
of them aunswered that she sawe him not there, but comming from
thens: then had she ynough, for well she wyste that he had the
same, and sent for him, but he could not be founde. Then she
caused her hosteler, in whome she had better affyaunce in for his
trouth,—and yet not one amongst twenty of them but haue well
left there honesty, (As I here a great sorte saye)—to come vnto
her, whiche attended to knowe her pleasure. “Goe, seke out,”
saythe she, “my vntowarde sonne, and byd hym come speake
with me.” “I sawe him go out,” saythe he, “halfe an houre
<span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>

of your arrante.” “I sent him not,” quoth she; “goe, loke him
out.”</p>

<p>¶ This hollowe hosteler toke his staffe in his necke, and trodged
out apase that waye he sawe him before go, and had some vnderstanding,
by one of the maydens, that his mistres had her whistell stolen
<i>and</i> suspected her sonne; and he had not gone farre but that he
espyed him comming homeward alone, and, meting him, axed where he
had ben. <span class="spleaf">[leaf 19, back]</span> “Where haue I bene?” q<i>uoth</i> he, and began
to smyle. “Now, by the mas, thou hast bene at some baudy
banquet.” “Thou hast euen tolde trouth,” q<i>uoth</i> thys chamberlayne.
“Sewerly,” q<i>uoth</i> this hosteler, “thou haddest the same
woman that begged at our house to day, for <i>th</i>e harmes she had by
fyre: where is she?” q<i>uoth</i> he. “She is almost a myle by this
tyme,” q<i>uoth</i> this chamberlayne. “Where is my mystres whystell?”
quoth this hosteler; “for I am well assured that thou haddest it,
and I feare me thou hast geuen it to that harlot.” “Why! is it
myssed?” quoth this chamberlayne. “Yea,” q<i>uoth</i> this hosteler,
and shewed him all the hole circumstaunce, what was both sayde
and thought on him for the thing. “Well, I wyl tell the,” quoth
this Chamberlayne. “I wylbe playne with the. I had it in dede,
and haue geue<i>n</i> the same to this woman, and I praye the make the
best of it, and helpe nowe to excuse the matter, and yet surely
and thou wouldest take so much payne for me as to ouer take her,
(for she goeth but softly, and is not yet farre of) and take the same
from her, and I am euer thyne assured fréende.” “Why, then, go
with me,” quoth this hostler. “Nay, in faythe,” quoth this Chamberlayne;
“what is frear then gift? and I hadde prety pastime for the
same.” “Hadest thou so?” quoth this hosteler; “nowe, by the
masse, and I wyll haue some to, or I wyll lye in the duste or I come
agayne.” Passing with hast to ouer take this paramoure, within a
myle fro<i>m</i> <i>th</i>e place where he departed he ouertoke her, hauing an
vpright man in her company, a stronge and a sturdye vacabond:
some what amased was this hosteler to se one familiarly in her company,
for he had well hopped to haue had some delycate dalyance,
as his fellowe hadde; but, seinge the matter so fallout,
and being of <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
good corage, and thinking to him selfe that one true man was better
then two false knaues, and being on the high way, thought vpon
helpe, if nede had bene, by such as had passed to and fro, Demaunded
fersely the whistell that she had euyn nowe of his fellowe.
“Why, husband,” quoth she, “can you suffer this wretche to
slaunder your wyfe?” “A vaunt verlet,” quoth this vpright man,
and letes dryue with all his force at this hosteler, and after halfe<a class="afnanc" href="#fn133" id="fnanc133">133</a>
a dosen blowes, he strycks his staffe out of his hande, and as this
hosteler stept backe to haue taken vp his staffe agayne, his glymmeringe
Morte flinges a great stone at him, and strake him one the heade
that downe hee fales, wyth the bloud about his eares, and whyle hée
laye this amased, the vpright man snatches awaye his pursse, where
in hée hadde money of his mystresses as well as of his owne, and
there let him lye, and went a waye with spede that they were neuer
harde of more. When this drye beaten hosteler was come to him
selfe, hée fayntlye wandereth home, and crepethe in to hys couche,
and restes <span class="spleaf">[leaf 20]</span> his ydle heade: his mystres harde that hée was
come in, and layde him downe on his beade, repayred straight vnto
him, and aske hym what he ayled, and what the cause was of his so
sudden lying one his bed. “What is the cause?” quoth this
hosteler; “your whystell, your whistel,”—speaking the same
pyteouslye thre or foure tymes. “Why, fole,” quoth his mystrisse,
“take no care for that, for I doe not greatly waye it; it was worth
but thrée shyllinges foure pens.” “I would it had bene burnt for
foure yeares agon.” “I praye the why so,” quoth his mystres; “I
think thou art mad.” “Nay, not yet,” quoth this hosteler, “but I
haue bene madly handlyd.” “Why, what is the matter?” quoth
his mystres, and was more desirous to know the case. “<i>And</i> you
wyl for geue my fellowe and me, I wyll shewe you, or els I wyll
neuer doe it.” Shée made hym presently faithfull promisse that shée
woulde. “Then,” saythe hee, “sende for your sonne home agayne,
whyche is ashamed to loke you in the face.” “I agre there to,”
sayth shée. “Well, then,” quoth this hosteler, “youre sonne hathe
geuen the same Morte that begged here, for the burninge of her
house, a whystell, and you haue geuen her v. shyllinges in money,
<span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
and I haue geuen her ten shyllinges of my owne.” “Why, howe
so?” quoth she. Then he sadly shewed her of his myshap, with all
the circumstaunce that you haue harde before, and howe hys pursse
was taken awaye, and xv. shyllinges in the same, where of v. shyllinges
was her money and x. shyllinges his owne money. “Is this
true?” quoth his mystres. “I, by my trouth,” quoth this hosteler,
“and nothing greues me so much, neyther my beating, neither the
losse of my money, as doth my euell <i>and</i> wreched lucke.” “Why,
what is the matter?” quoth his mystres. “Your sonne,” saythe
this hosteler, “had some chere and pastyme for that whystell, for he
laye with her, and I haue bene well beaten, and haue had my pursse
taken from me, and you knowe your sonne is merrye and pleasaunt,
and can kepe no great councell; and then shall I bemocked <i>and</i>
loughed to skorne in all places when they shall here howe I haue
bene serued.” “Nowe, out vpon you knaues both,” quoth his
mystres, and laughes oute the matter; for she well sawe it would
not other wyse preuayle.</p>

<p>¶ The last Sommer, Anno domini .1566, being in familiare
talke with a walking Mort that came to my gate, I learned by her
what I could, and I thought I had gathered as much for my purpose
as I desired. I began to rebuke her for her leud lyfe and beastly
behauor, declaring to her what punishment was prepared and heaped
vp for her in the world to come for her fylthy lyuinge and wretched
conuersation. “God helpe,” q<i>uoth</i> she, “how should I lyue? none
wyll take me into seruice; but I labour in haruest time honestly.”
“I thinke but a whyle with honestie,” q<i>uoth</i> I. “Shall I tell you,”
q<i>uoth</i> she, “the best of vs all may be amended; but yet, I thanke
god, I dyd one good dede within this twelue mo<i>n</i>thes.” “Wherein?”
q<i>uoth</i> I. Sayth she, “I woulde not haue it spoken of agayne.”
“Yf it be méete and necessary,” q<i>uo</i>d I, “it shall lye vnder my
feete.” “What meane you by that?” quoth she. “I meane,” q<i>uo</i>d
I, “to hide the same, and neuer to discouer it to any.” “Well,”
q<i>uoth</i> she, and began to laugh as much as she could, and sweare by
the masse that if I disclosed the same to any, she woulde neuer more<a class="afnanc" href="#fn138" id="fnanc138">138</a>
tell me any thinge. “The last sommer,” q<i>uoth</i> she, “I was greate
with chylde, and I traueled into east kent by the sea coste, for I
lusted meruelously after oysters and muskels<a class="afnanc" href="#fn139" id="fnanc139">139</a>, and gathered many,
and in <i>th</i>e place where I found them, I opened them and eate them
styll: at the last, in seking more, I reached after one, and stept into
a hole, and fel in into the wast, and their dyd stycke, and I had
bene drowned if the tide had come, and espyinge a man a good waye
of, I cried as much as I could for helpe. I was alone, he hard
me, and repaired as fast to me as he might, and finding me their fast
stycking, I required for gods sake his helpe; and whether it was with
stryuinge and forcing my selfe out, or for ioye I had of his comminge
to me, I had a great couller in my face, and loked red and well
<span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
coullered. And, to be playne with you, hée lyked me so well (as he
sayd) that I should there lye styll, and I would not graunt him, that
he might lye with me. And, by my trouth, I wist not what to
answeare, I was in such a perplexite; for I knew the man well: he
had a very honest woman to his wyfe, and was of some welth; and,
one the other syde, if I weare not holpe out, I should there haue
perished, and I graunted hym that I would obeye to his wyll: then
he plucked me out. And because there was no conuenient place nere
hande, I required hym that I might go washe my selfe, and make me
somewhat clenly, and I would come to his house and lodge all night
in his barne, whether he mighte repaire to me, and accomplyshe hys
desire, ‘but let it not be,’ quoth she,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn140" id="fnanc140">140</a>
‘before nine of the clocke at
nyghte <span class="spleaf">[leaf 22]</span> for then there wylbe small styrring. And I may repaire
to the towne,’ q<i>uoth</i> she,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn141" id="fnanc141">141</a>
‘to warme and drye my selfe’; for
this was about two of the clocke in the after none. ‘Do so,’ quoth
hée; ‘for I must be busie to looke oute my cattell here by before I
can come home.’ So I went awaye from hym, and glad was I.”
“And why so?” quoth I. “Because,” quoth she, “his wyfe, my
good dame, is my very fréend, and I am much beholdinge to her.
And she hath donne me so much good or this, that I weare loth nowe
to harme her any waye.” “Why,” quoth I, “what and it hadde
béene any other man, and not your good dames husbande?” “The
matter had bene the lesse,” quoth shée. “Tell me, I pray the,”
quoth I, “who was the father of thy chylde?” She stodyd a whyle,
and sayde that it hadde a father. “But what was hée?” quoth I.
“Nowe, by my trouth, I knowe not,” quoth shée; “you brynge me
out of my matter so, you do.” “Well, saye on,” quoth I. “Then I
departed strayght to the towne, and came to my dames house, And
shewed her of my mysfortune, also of her husbands vsage, in all
pointes, and that I showed her the same for good wyll, and byde her
take better héede to her husbande, and to her selfe: so shée gaue me

and drynke; and wyth the oysters I broughte with me, I hadde greate
cheere: shée wente strayght and repaired vnto her gossypes dwelling
there by; and, as I dyd after vnderstande, she made her mone to
them, what a naughtye, lewed, lecherous husbande shée hadde, and
howe that she coulde not haue hys companye for harlotes, and that
she was in feare to take some fylthy dysease of hym, he was so
commen a man, hauinge lytle respecte whome he hadde to do with
all; ‘and,’ quoth she, ‘nowe here is one at my house, a poore woman
that goeth aboute the countrey that he woulde haue hadde to doe

deuyse some remedy to make my husband a good man, <i>tha</i>t I may
lyue in some suerty without disease, and that hée may saue his soule
that God so derelye <span class="spleaf">[leaf 22, back]</span> bought.’ After shée hadde tolde her
tale, they caste their persinge eyes all vpon her, but one stoute dame
amongst the rest had these wordes—‘As your pacient bearinge of
troubles, your honest behauiour among vs your neyghbours, your
tender and pytifull hart to the poore of the parysh, doth moue vs to
lament your case, so the vnsatiable carnalite of your faithelesse husbande
doth instigate and styre vs to deuyse and inuent some spéedy
redresse for your ease<a class="afnanc" href="#fn144" id="fnanc144">144</a>
and the amendement of hys lyfe. Wherefore,
this is my councell and you wyll bée aduertysed by me; for<a class="afnanc" href="#fn145" id="fnanc145">145</a>
I saye
to you all, vnlesse it be this good wyfe, who is chéefely touched in
this matter, I haue the nexte cause; for hée was in hande wyth me
not longe a goe, and companye had not bene present, which was by
a meruelous chaunce, he hadde, I thinke, forced me. For often hée
hath bene tempering<a class="afnanc" href="#fn146" id="fnanc146">146</a>
with me, and yet haue I sharpely sayde him
<span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
naye: therefore, let vs assemble secretly into the place where hée
hathe apuynted to méete thys gyllot that is at your house, and lyrke
preuelye in some corner tyll hée begyn to goe aboute his busines.
And then me thought I harde you saye euen nowe that you had a
watche word, at which word we wyll all stepforth, being fiue of vs
besydes you, for you shalbe none because it is your husbande, but
gette you to bed at your accustomed houre. And we wyll cary eche
of vs<a class="afnanc" href="#fn147" id="fnanc147">147</a>
good byrchen rodde in our lappes, and we will all be muffeled
for knowing, and se that you goe home and acquaynt that walking
Morte with the matter; for we must haue her helpe to hold, for
alwaies foure must hold and two lay one.’ ‘Alas!’ sayth this good
wyfe, ‘he is to stronge for you all. I would be loth, for my sake
you should receaue harme at his hande.’ ‘feare you not,’ q<i>uoth</i> these
stout wemen, ‘let her not geue the watch word vntyl his hosen be
abaut his legges. And I trowe we all wylbe with him to bring
before he shall haue leasure to plucke them vp againe.’ They all
with on voyce ag[r]ed to the matter, that the way she had deuised was
the best: so this good wife repaired home; but before she departed
from her gossypes, she shewed them at what houre they should
preuely come in on <i>th</i>e backsid, <i>and</i> where to tary their good our:
so by <i>th</i>e time she came in, it was all most night, and found the walking
Morte still setting by the fyre, and declared to her all this new
deuyse aboue sayd, which promised faythfully to full fyll to her small
powre as much as they hadde deuysed: within a quarter of an oure
after, in co<i>m</i>meth the good man, who said that he was about his
cattell. “Why, what haue we here, wyfe, setting by the fyre? <i>and</i>
yf she haue eate and dronke, send her into the barne to her lodging
for this night, for she troubeleth the house.” “Euen as you wyll
husbande,” sayth his wyfe; “you knowe she commeth once in two
yeres into these <span class="spleaf">[leaf 23]</span> quarters. Awaye,” saythe this good wyfe,
“to your lodginge.” “Yes, good dame,” sayth she, “as fast as I
can:” thus, by loking one<a class="afnanc" href="#fn148" id="fnanc148">148</a>
on the other, eche knewe others mynde,
and so departed to her comely couche: the good man of the house
shrodge hym for Ioye, thinking to hym selfe, I wyll make some pastyme
with you anone. And calling to his wyfe for hys sopper, set
<span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
him downe, and was very plesant, and dranke to his wyfe, <i>and</i> fell
to his mammerings, and mounched a pace, nothing vnderstanding of
the bancquet that<a class="afnanc" href="#fn149" id="fnanc149">149</a>
was a preparing for him after sopper, <i>and</i> according
to the prouerbe, that swete meate wyll haue sowre sawce: thus, whe<i>n</i>
he was well refreshed, his sprietes being reuyued, entred into familiare
talke with his wife, of many matters, how well he had spent
that daye to both there proffytes, sayinge some of his cattell<a class="afnanc" href="#fn150" id="fnanc150">150</a>
were
lyke to haue bene drowned in the dyches, dryuinge others of his
neyghbours cattell out that were in his pastures, <i>and</i> mending his
fences that were broken downe. Thus profitably he had consumed
the daye, nothinge talking of his helping out of the walkinge Morte
out of the myre, nether of his request nor yet of her<a class="afnanc" href="#fn151" id="fnanc151">151</a>
promisse.
Thus feding her w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> frendly fantacyes, consumed two houres and
more. Then fayninge howe hée would se in what case his horse
were in and howe they were dressed, Repaired couertly into the
barne, where as his frée[n]dlye foes lyrked preuely, vnlesse it were
this manerly Morte, that comly couched on a bottell of strawe.
“What, are you come?” q<i>uoth</i> she; “by the masse, I would not
for a hundreth pound that my dame should knowe that you were
here, eyther any els of your house.” “No, I warrant the,” sayth
this good man, “they be all safe and fast ynough at their woorke,
and I wylbe at mine anon.” And laye downe by her, and strayght
would haue had to do w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her. “Nay, fye,” sayth she, “I lyke
not this order: if ye lye with me, you shall surely vntrus you <i>and</i>
put downe your hosen, for that way is most easiest and best.”
“Sayest thou so?” quoth he, “now, by my trouth agred.” And
when he had vntrussed him selfe and put downe, he began to assalt
the vnsatiable<a class="afnanc" href="#fn152" id="fnanc152">152</a>
fort “Why,” quoth she, that was with out shame,
sauinge for her promes, “And are you not ashamed?” “neuer a
whyte,” sayth he, “lye downe quickely.” “Now, fye, for shame,
fye,” sayth shée a loude, whyche was the watche word. At the
which word, these fyue furious, sturdy, muffeled gossypes flynges
oute, and takes sure holde of this be trayed parson, sone<a class="afnanc" href="#fn153" id="fnanc153">153</a>
pluckinge
his hosen downe lower, and byndinge the same fast about his féete;
<span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
then byndinge his handes, and knitting a hande charcher about his
eyes, that he shoulde not sée; and when they had made hym sure
and fast, Then they layd him one vntyll they weare windles. “Be
good,” sayth this Morte, “vnto my maister, for the passion of God,”
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 23, back]</span> and layd on as fast as the rest, and styll seased not to
crye vpon them to bée mercyfull vnto hym, and yet layde on a pace;
and when they had well beaten hym, that the bloud braste plentifullye
oute in most places, they let hym lye styll bounde. With
this exhortation, that he shoulde from that tyme forth knowe his
wyfe from other mens, and that this punishment was but a flebyting
in respect of that which should followe, yf he amended not his
manners. Thus leuynge hym blustering, blowing, and fominge for
payne, and malyncolye that hée neither might or coulde be reuenged
of them, they vanyshed awaye, and hadde thys Morte with them,
and safely conuayde her out of the towne: sone after co<i>m</i>meth into
the barne one of the good mans boyes, to fet some haye for his horse.
And fyndinge his maister lyinge faste bounde and greuouslye beaten
with rodes, was sodenly abashed and woulde haue runne out agayne
to haue called for helpe; but his maister bed hym come vnto hym
and vnbynd hym; “and make no wordes,” quoth he, “of this. I
wylbe reuenged well inoughe;” yet not with standinge, after better
aduyse, the matter beinge vnhonest, he thought it meter to let the
same passe, and, not, as the prouerbe saythe, to awake the sleping
dogge. “And, by my trouth,” quoth this walkinge Morte, “I come
nowe from that place, and was neuer there sythens this parte was
playde, whiche is some what more then a yeare. And I here a very
good reporte of hym now, that he loueth his wyfe well, and vseth
hym selfe verye honestlye; and was not this a good acte? nowe, howe
saye you?” “It was pretely handeled,” quoth I, “and is here all?”
“Yea,” quoth she, “here is the ende.”</p>

I chaunced, not longe sithens, familiarly to commen with a
Doxe that came to my gate, and surelye a pleasant harlot, and not so
pleasant as wytty, and not so wytty as voyd of all grace and goodnes.
I founde, by her talke, that shée hadde passed her tyme lewdlye
eyghttene yeares in walkinge aboute. I thoughte this a necessary
instrument to attayne some knowledge by; and before I woulde
grope her mynde, I made her both to eate and drynke well; that
done, I made her faythfull promisse to geue her some money, yf she
would open and dyscouer to me such questions as I woulde demaunde
of her, and neuer to bée wraye her, neither to disclose her name.
“And you shoulde,” sayth she, “I were vndon:” “feare not that,”
quoth I; “but, I praye the,” quoth I, “say nothing but trouth.”
“I wyll not,” sayth shée. “Then, fyrste tell me,” quoth I, “how
many vpright men and Roges dost thou knowe, or hast thou knowne
and byn conuersaunt with, and what their names be?” She paused
a whyle, and sayd, “why do you aske me, or wherefore?” “For
nothinge els,” as I sayde, “but that I woulde knowe them when
they came to my gate.” “Nowe, by my trouth” (quoth she) “then
are yea neuer the neare, for all myne acquayntaunce, for the moste
parte, are deade.” “Dead!” quoth I, “howe dyed they, for wante
of cherishinge, or of paynefull diseases?” Then she sighed, and
sayde they were hanged. “What, all?” quoth I, “and so manye
walke abroade, as I dayelye see?” “By my trouth,” quoth she, “I
<span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
knowe not paste six or seuen by their names,” and named the same
to me. “When were they hanged?” quoth I. “Some seuen yeares
a gone, some thrée yeares, and some w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this fortnight,” and declared
the place where they weare executed, which I knewe well to
bée true, by the report of others. “Why” (quoth I) “dyd not this
sorrowfull and fearefull sight much greue the, and for thy tyme longe
and euyll spent?” “I was sory,” quoth shée, “by the Masse; for
some of them were good louing men. For I lackt not when they
had it, and they wanted not when I had it, and diuers of them I
neuer dyd forsake, vntyll the Gallowes departed vs.” “O, mercyfull
God!” quoth I, and began to blesse me. “Why blesse ye?” quoth
she. “Alas! good gentleman, euery one muste haue a lyuinge.”
Other matters I talked of; but this nowe maye suffice to shewe
the Reader, as it weare in a glasse, the bolde beastly lyfe of these
Doxes. For suche as hath gone anye tyme abroade, wyll neuer forsake
their trade, to dye therefore. I haue hadde good profe thereof.

I thinke it not vnnecessary to make the Reader vnderstand
how and in what maner they lodge a nights in barnes
or backe houses, and of their vsage there, for asmuch as I
haue acquaynted them with their order and practises a day
times. The arche and chiefe walkers that hath walked a
long time, whose experience is great, because of their continuinge
practise, I meane all Mortes and Doxes, for their handsomnes and
diligence for making of their couches. The men neuer trouble them
selues with <i>tha</i>t thing, but takes the same to be the dutye of <i>th</i>e
wyfe. And she shuffels vp a quayntitye of strawe or haye into
some pretye carner of the barne <span class="spleaf">[leaf 25]</span> where she maye conuenientlye
lye, and well shakethe the same, makinge the heade some
what hye, and dryues the same vpon the sydes and fete lyke abed:
then she layeth her wallet, or some other lytle pack of ragges or
scrype vnder her heade in the strawe, to beare vp the same, and
layethe her petycote or cloke vpon and ouer the strawe, so made lyke
a bedde, and that serueth for the blancket. Then she layeth her
slate, which is her sheete, vpon that; and she haue no shéete, as
fewe of them goe without, then she spreddeth some large cloutes or
rags ouer the same, and maketh her ready, and layeth her drouselye
downe. Many wyll plucke of their smockes, and laye the same vpon
them in stede of their vpper shéete, and all her other pelte and
<span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
trashe vpon her also; and many lyeth in their smockes. And if the
rest of her clothes in colde weather be not sufficient to kepe her
warme, then she taketh strawe or haye to performe the matter. The
other sorte, that haue not slates, but toumble downe and couche a
hogshead in their clothes, these bée styll lousye, and shall neuer be
with out vermyn, vnlesse they put of theire clothes, and lye as is a
boue sayde. If the vpright man come in where they lye, he hath
his choyse, and crepeth in close by his Doxe: the Roge hath his
leauings. If the Morts or Doxes lye or be lodged in some Farmers
barne, and the dore be ether locked or made fast to them, then wyl
not the vpright man presse to come in, Vnles it be in barnes and
oute houses standinge alone, or some distance from houses, which be
commonly knowne to them, As saint Quintens, thrée Cranes of the

are their chiefe houses neare about London, where commonly they

is Ketbroke, standinge by blacke heath, halfe a myle from anye
house. There wyll they boldlye drawe the latche of the doore, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
go in when the good man with hys famyly be at supper, and syt
downe without leaue, and eate and drinke with them, and either lye
in the hall by the fyre all night, or in <i>th</i>e barne, if there be no rome
in the house for them. If the doore be eyther bolted or lockt, if it
be not opened vnto them when they wyl, they wyl breake the same
open to his farther cost. And in this barne sometyme do lye xl.
vpright men with their Doxes together at one time. And this must
the poore Farmer suffer, or els they threaten him to burne him, and
all that he hath.</p>

<p class="phanga padtopb">A sermon made by P<i>ar</i>son Haben vppon a

   id="fnanc184">184</a> at the Comaundment of vij. theves,
   whoe, after they had robbed him, Comaunded him to Preache
   before them.</p>

<p class="padtopb">I Marvell that eu<i>er</i>ye man will seme to dispraise theverye,
and thinke the doers thereof worthye of Death, when it is a
thinge that Cometh nere vnto vertve, and is vsed of all men,
of all sort<i>es</i> and in all countryes, and soe comaunded and
allowed of god himselfe which thinge, because I cannot soe
sapiently shewe vnto you a<a class="afnanc" href="#fn185"
id="fnanc185">185</a> soe shorte a tyme and in soe shorte a
place, I shall desire you, gentle theves, to take in good
p<i>ar</i>te this thinge that at this tyme Cometh to minde, not
misdoubtinge but you of yo<i>ur</i> good knowledge are able to ad
more vnto the same then this which I at this tyme shall shewe
vnto you. ffirst, fortitude and stoutnes, Courage, and boldnes
of stomacke, is Compted of some a vertue; which beinge graunted,
Whoe is he then that will not Iudge theves vertuous, most
stoute, most hardye? I most, withoute feare. As for stealinge,
that is a thinge vsuall:—whoe stealeth not? ffor not only you
that haue besett me, but many other in many places. Men, Woemen,
<i>and</i> Children, Riche and poore, are dailye of that facultye,
As the hange <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span> man of
Tiborne can testifye. That it is allowed of god himselfe, it is
euident in many storyes of the Scriptures. And if you liste to
looke in the whole Course of the bible, you shall finde that
theves haue bin belovid of god. ffor Iacobe, when he Came oute
of Mesopotamia, did steale his vncles lambes; the same Iacobe
stale his brother Esawes blessinge; and that god saide, “I haue
chosen Iacob and refused Esawe.” The Children of Isarell, when
they came oute of Egippe, didd steale the Egippsians Iewells
and ring<i>es</i>, and god comaunded the[m] soe to doe. David, in
the dayes of Ahemel[e]ch the preiste, came into the temple and
stole awaye the shewe bread; And yet god saide, “this is a man
accordinge to myne owne harte.” Alsoe Christe himsellfe, when he
was here vppon earth, did take an asse, a Colte, which was none
of his owne. And you knowe that god saide, “this is my now<i>n</i>e
sone, in whome I delighte.”</p>

<p>Thus maye you see that most of all god delighteth in theves. I
marvell, therefore, that men can despise yo<i>ur</i> lives, when that you
are in all poynts almost like vnto Christe; for Christ hade noe dwellinge
place,—noe more haue you. Christe, therefore, at the laste, was
laide waite for in all places,—and soe are you. Christe alsoe at the
laste was called for,—and soe shall you be. He was condemned,—soe
shall you be. Christe was hanged,—soe shall you be. He descended
into hell,—so shall you. But in one pointe you differ. He
assendid into heaven,—soe shall you never, without gods mercye,
Which god graunte for his mercyes sake! Toe whome, with the so<i>n</i>ne
and the holye goste, be all hono<i>ur</i> and glory for euer and euer.
Amen!</p>

Faires and Markets, that therby being warned, they may likewise be
armed, both to see the deceit, and shun the daunger. These shifters
will come vnto an Inne or vittailing house, that is most vsed in the

or other, to lay vp either cloke, sword, or any other thing woorth the

likewise goeth forth, and with a great countenance commeth in againe
to the mayde or seruant, calling for what another left: if they doubt
to deliuer it, then hee frets, and calles them at his pleasure, and tels
them the markes and tokens: hauing thus done, hee blames their forgetfulnes,

bidding them fetch it straight, and know him better the next time,

<h3 title="THE VISITOR">THE VISITER.</h3>

<p>An honest youth, not many yeares since, seruant in this City, had
leaue of his master at whitsontide to see his friends, who dwelt some
fifty miles from London. It hapned at a Country wake, his mother
and hee came acquainted with a precise scholler, that, vnder colour
of strickt life, hath bin reputed for that hee
is not: hee is well <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
knowen in Paules Churchyard, and hath beene lately a visiting in
Essex; for so he presumes to tearme his cosening walks: and therefore
wee will call him here a Visiter. This honest seeming man
must needes (sith his iourney lay to London) stay at the yong mans
mothers all the holy daies: where as on his desert hee was kindly
vsed; at length, the young man, hauing receiued his mother’s blessing,
with other his friendes giftes, amounting to some ten poundes,
was to this hypocrite as to a faithful guide committed, and toward
London they ride: by the way this Visiter discourses how excellent
insight he had in Magick, to recouer by Art anything lost or stolne.
Well, to sant Albons they reach; there they sup together, and, after
the carowsing of some quarts of wine, they go to bed, where they
kindly sleepe,—the Visiter slily, but the young man soundly. Short
tale to make—out of his bed-fellow’s sleeue this Visiter conuaid his
twenty Angels, besides some other od siluer, hid it closely, and so
fell to his rest. Morning comes—vp gets this couple—immediately
the money was mist, much adoo was made; the Chamberlaine with
sundry other seruants examined; and so hot the contention, that the
good man, for the discharge of his house, was sending for a Constable
to haue them both first searcht, his seruants Chests after. In the
meane time the Visiter cals the yong man aside, and bids him neuer
grieue, but take horse; and he warrants him, ere they be three miles
out of towne, to helpe him to his money by Art, saying:—“In these
Innes ye see how we shall be out-faced, and, beeing vnknowne, how
euer we be wrongd, get little remedy.” The yong man, in good
hope, desired him to pay the reckoning, which done, together they
ride. Being some two miles from the towne, they ride out of the
ordinary way: there he tels this youth how vnwilling hee was to
enter into the action, but that it was lost in his company, and so
forth. Well, a Circle was made, wondrous words were vsed, many
muttrings made: at length hee cries out,—“vnder a greene turfe, by
the East side of an Oake; goe thither, goe thither.” This thrice he
cryed so ragingly, as the yuong man gest him mad, and was with
feare almost beside himself. At length, pausing, quoth this Visiter,
“heard ye nothing cry?” “Cry!” said the yong man, “yes;
<span class="spleaf">[leaf 5, back]</span> you cride so as, for twise
ten pound, I would not heare ye <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
again.” “Then,” quoth he, “’tis all well, if ye remember the
words.” The yong man repeated them. With that this shifter said,
“Go to the furthest Oke in the high-way towards S. Albons, and
vnder a greene turfe, on the hither side, lyes your mony, and a note
of his name that stole it. Hence I cannot stirre till you returne;
neyther may either of our horses be vntide for that time: runne yee
must not, but keepe an ordinary pace.” Away goes the yong man
gingerly; and, being out of sight, this copesmate takes his cloke-bag,
wherein was a faire sute of apparel, and, setting spurres to his horse,
was, ere the Nouice returned, ridde cleane out of his view. The
yong man, seeing himselfe so coossened, made patience his best
remedie, tooke his horse, and came to London, where yet it was neuer
his lucke to meet this visiter.</p>

<div class="fsz7">[Headnote: A SHIFTER DESCRIBED.]</div>

<h3 title="A SHIFTER">A SHIFTER.</h3>

<p>A Shifter, not long since, going ordinarily booted, got leaue of a
Carrier to ride on his owne hackney a little way from London, who,
comming to the Inne where the Carier that night should lodge,
honestly set vp the horse, and entred the hal, where were at one
table some three and thirty clothiers, all returning to their seuerall
countries. Vsing, as he could, his curtesie, and being Gentleman-like
attirde, he was at all their instance placed at the vpper end by
the hostesse. After hee had a while eaten, he fel to discourse with
such pleasance, that all the table were greatly delighted therewith.
In the midst of supper enters a noise of musitions, who with their
instruments added a double delight. For them hee requested his
hostesse to laye a shoulder of mutton and a couple of capons to the
fire, for which he would pay, <i>and</i> then mooued in their behalfe to
gather. Among them a noble was made, which he fingring, was well
blest; for before he had not a crosse, yet he promist to make it vp
an angel. To be short, in comes the reckoning, which (by reason of
the fine fare <i>and</i> excesse of wine) amounted to each mans halfe crown.
Then hee requested his hostesse to prouide so many possets of sacke,
as would furnish the table, which he would bestow on the Gentlemen
to requite their extraordinary costs: <i>and</i> iestingly
askt if she would <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span>
make him her deputie to gather the reckoning; she graunted, and he
did so: and on a sodaine, (faining to hasten his hostesse with the
possets) he tooke his cloke, and, finding fit time, hee slipt out of
doores, leauing the guestes and their hostesse to a new reckoning,
<i>and</i> the musitians to a good supper, but they paid for the sauce.
This iest some vntruly attribute to a man of excellent parts about
London, but he is slandered: the party that performed it hath scarce
any good qualitie to liue. Of these sort I could set downe a great
number, but I leaue you now vnto those which by Maister Harman
are discouered.</p>

<div class="dtransnote" id="idtransnote">TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">This is a Distributed Proofreaders
(<span class="smmaj">DP</span>) transcription of the 1869
Edition of <i>Awdeley’s Fraternitye of Vacabondes, Harmon’s
Caueat, Haben’s Sermon, &amp;c.</i>, by the Early English
Text Society (<span class="smmaj">EETS</span>). The <span
class="smmaj">EETS</span> book is itself an annotated
transcription of earlier manuscripts, as for instance, the
1575 edition of <i>The Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i> by John
Awdeley. This <span class="smmaj">DP</span> transcription
is available in several editions, including simple text,
html, epub, and mobi. Original page images from the <span
class="smmaj">EETS</span> edition are available from
archive.org—search for “fraternityeofvac00vilerich”. I produced
the <span class="smmaj">DP</span> cover image, and hereby assign
it to the public domain.</p>

<p>The original spelling and grammar of the <span
class="smmaj">EETS</span> edition have been retained, with
some exceptions noted below. Space before punctuation such as
colon, semicolon, question mark, or exclamation mark have been
generally eliminated.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smmaj">DP</span> simple text edition,
original small caps are uppercase, and italics look _like this_.
Superscripts are indicated like these: “a^o” or “iij^{li}”.
Large initial letters in the <span class="smmaj">EETS</span>
edition are marked with leading double ++ as in “++THes”. The
variation between capital and lower-case letters after an
initial large capital is as in the original. The letter <i>n</i>
with macron is marked <i>n̄</i>, using the combining macron Unicode
character. The code “[l~l]” denotes <i>ll</i> with a tilde through
the two letters <i>l</i>. The Unicode character [“ɳ” u0273, latin
small letter n with retroflex hook] has been substituted for the
letter <i>n</i> with right hook in the text edition.</p>

<p>The <span class="smmaj">DP</span> html/epub/mobi editions
employ images: <span class="nowrap"> “<img class="iglyph-c"
src="images/n.with.macron.png" width="37" height="60" alt="n̄"
/>” </span> for the <i>n</i> with macron; <span class="nowrap">
“<img class="iglyph-c" src="images/p093-l-tilde-l.png"
width="44" height="71" alt="[l~l]" />” </span> for the <i>ll</i>
with tilde, and <span class="nowrap"> “<img class="iglyph-c"
src="images/p093-nhook.png" width="51" height="62" alt="[n
with hook]" />”</span> for the <i>n</i> with hook. An image is also
employed for the sparsely-supported unicode character [“☞”
u261e, white right-pointing index].</p>

<p>Footnotes have been relabeled 1–185, and moved from within
paragraphs to nearby locations between paragraphs. In the <span
class="smmaj">EETS</span> edition, replicated footnote anchors
were occasionally used to delineate specific ranges of text.
In this <span class="smmaj">DP</span> transcription, footnote
anchors are unique, so other symbols from the set {†‡§&#x2a;} have
been inserted to delineate the ranges.</p>

<p>The <span class="smmaj">EETS</span> book contains notations
like “[leaf 4]”, which refer to the leaf in the original
manuscript. These are retained. Page numbers as printed in the
<span class="smmaj">EETS</span> edition are shown like this:
“{xiii}” or “{53}”.</p>

<p>The <span class="smmaj">EETS</span> edition was printed with
running heads, which I will call headnotes herein. Most of the
original headnotes were either repetitions from previous pages,
or else essentially the same as a text heading or subheading
somewhere on the page in question. A few did add information to
the page; these few have been retained in this transcription.
They have been moved if necessary from the top of the page to
the top of the section that they describe. The first example of
an included headnote occurs on page <a href="#p019"
title="go to page 19">19</a>.</p>

acceptably reproduce these two lines as printed. In this <span
class="smmaj">DP</span> transcription, a new right bracket “&nbsp;}” is
inserted to enclose the words of the two lines as printed. In the text
edition, the markup “++{&nbsp;” is employed at the beginning of the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
